<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This treatise is the outcome of a continuous personal
interest in railroads, practically coincident in point of time with
the period of active participation of the Federal government
in their affairs. During these years, since 1887 when the Act
to Regulate Commerce was passed, as the problem of public
regulation has gradually unfolded, opportunity has offered
itself to me to view the subject from different angles. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as instructor of embryo
engineers in the economic aspects of their callings; in service
for the United States Industrial Commission in 1900-01, in
touch alike with government officials and, travelling all about
the country, with shippers and commercial bodies during a
period of acute unrest; and finally ripening the practical experience,
thus gained, in the favoring atmosphere of Harvard
University, seeking to imbue future citizens with a sense of
their civic responsibilities; through all these years, the conviction
has steadily grown that, as one of the most fundamental
agents in our American economic affairs, the subjection of transportation
to public control was a primary need of the time.
An earnest effort has been made to set down the facts concerning
this highly controversial subject with scientific rigor and with
fairness to all three of the great parties concerned, the owners,
the shippers and the people. If bias there be, it will in all likelihood
be found to favor the welfare of the "dim inarticulate
multitude,"&mdash;that so inert mass of interests and aspirations,
too indefinitely informed as to details and too much occupied
in earning its daily bread, to be able to analyze its own vital
concerns, to give expression to its will, and even sometimes, as
it seems, wisely to choose its spokesmen and representatives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
It is this helpless and unorganized general public, always in
need of an advocate, which, perhaps, most strongly appeals to
the academic mind. If there be lack of judicial poise in
this regard, it is, at all events, palliated by free confession in
advance.</p>

<p>Nor is the history of the assumption by public authority of
its inherent right to control railroads, as narrow an interest
as it at first appears. Transportation, as a service, is the
commodity produced by common carriers. The manner in
which the price of this commodity has been brought under
governmental regulation has a direct bearing upon another
problem just beginning to open up; namely that of the control
by the state of the prices of other things. It is not
unlikely, in my judgment, that the final solution of the so-called
Trust Problem in the United States, whether for good
or ill, may ultimately contain as one important feature, the
determination by governmental authority of reasonable prices
for such prime necessities of life as milk, ice, coal, sugar and
oil, when produced under monopolistic conditions. This view
is shared by my colleague Professor Taussig in his "Principles
of Economics." It is also distinctly set forth by President
Van Hise of the University of Wisconsin, in his recent "Concentration
and Control." When the seed of such an industrial
policy is planted, as I believe it possible in time, the soil will
have been richly prepared for its reception by our experience
in the determination of reasonable charges for the services of
railroads and other public utilities.</p>

<p>A word of explanation may also be offered to the reader
who finds in these pages an almost exuberant mass of illustrative
material. Possibly, even, it may be alleged that in places
so thick are the circumstantial trees of evidence that one can
scarcely perceive the wood of principle. But, under the circumstances,
it is almost inevitable that this should be so. The
method of inquiry adopted has been mainly inductive. Text
books and theoretical treatises have been used only by the way.
I hold them to be merely of secondary importance. The
principal reliance has been upon concrete data, painstakingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
gathered through many years from original sources. In this
present excursion in the far more complex domain of the social
sciences, an endeavor has been made to adhere strictly to the
same scientific method pursued in the field of natural science in
writing "The Races of Europe." A search far and wide for
every possible bit of raw material had to be made at the outset.
To this succeeded the classification and realignment of the
concrete data thus obtained. The last step of all, was the
formulation of the governing economic principles. But an
almost indispensable result of this mode of work is a plenitude
of reference and example. One might almost say that under
such circumstances it becomes second nature to demand concrete
illustration for every economic theory or principle laid
down. Such a statement, however, would be fallacious. It
would misrepresent the true sequence of events as above outlined.
Rather should it be affirmed, that, inasmuch as the
concrete examples are the sources of the reasoning, no theory
can be held valid for which somewhere or somehow, positive
illustration drawn from practice cannot be found. Such an
ideal is, indeed, difficult to attain; but it may be stated as a
cardinal principle to be always kept in mind. And it ought
to excuse an author from the charge of over-elaboration of
detail in illustration. The only crimes for which no verbal
atonement will suffice are that the chosen illustration does not
fit the principle, or else that the facts have been distorted to
serve a preconceived idea.</p>

<p>References throughout this work to a second volume will be
noted. This will deal primarily with matters of finance and
corporate relations. The general subject of railroad combination
was necessarily relegated to another set of covers. This,
however, is quite fitting, inasmuch as the connection between
matters of finance and organization is at all times so intimate
and necessary. The development of inter-railway relationships
has been, perhaps, next to the establishment of government
regulation, the most striking phenomenon of the last decade.
It is absolutely essential to a comprehension of present day
financial problems, to understand the nature and extent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
consolidation of interests which obtains. This second volume,
now nearly completed, will, it is hoped, appear early in 1913.</p>

<p>This volume is also frequently linked by means of cross
references to a set of reprints of notable interstate commerce
cases or special articles which was published some years ago
as "Railway Problems." (Ginn &amp; Co.) Much new material
having accumulated since its original appearance in 1907, it
is the intention to prepare a new and revised edition, particularly
designed as an accompaniment to this treatise. But
the same chapter numbers will be preserved for all material
taken over from the first edition.</p>

<p>Many friends and specialists, who shall be unnamed, have
been of assistance in various ways for which I am duly grateful.
But a few have been so peculiarly helpful that it is fitting to
make more particular mention of my personal obligation. Especially
is this true of Hon. Balthasar H. Meyer of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, from whom through many years
of friendship and common interest in the subject, have come
all sorts of aid and suggestion. Prof. F. H. Dixon of Dartmouth
College, Statistician of the Bureau of Railway Economics
at Washington, also a co-worker in the same field, has always
without reserve freely shared the best he had to give. I have
drawn liberally from his special contributions on transportation,
particularly in the history of recent Federal legislation.
Despite the difference in our point of view, the always friendly
criticism of Frederic A. Delano, President of the Wabash
Railroad, has been most welcome and serviceable. In matters
of classification, Mr. D. O. Ives, Traffic Expert of the Boston
Chamber of Commerce, has extended a helping hand. And I
have profited greatly from the published work of Mr. Samuel
O. Dunn, now Editor of the <i>Railway Age Gazette</i>. In this
connection, acknowledgment should be made of my deep obligation
to the other editors of that admirable technical journal,
who have in series during a number of years afforded me an
opportunity of reaching a class of readers and, it should be
added, not infrequently of unsparing critics, whose intelligence
and technical knowledge have held me to a strict accounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
in all matters of fact or principle. Without this critical oversight,
many statements, happily now tested, would have held
less secure place. Then again, there is the entire staff of the
Interstate Commerce Commission to whom I have been a care
and trouble for so many years. Ungrudgingly have its members
always given response to all sorts of requests, whether
for documents, statistics or opinions. Without the official
stores of information at Washington, this present volume would
have been woefully incomplete.</p>

<p>The possibility of a unified nation of ninety odd million
souls, spread over a vast territory of three million square miles,&mdash;three-fourths
of the area of Europe,&mdash;was greatly enhanced
at the outset by the geographical configuration of the continent
of North America. It was fortunate, indeed, that the original
thirteen colonies were strictly hemmed in along the Atlantic
seaboard, thus being protected against premature expansion.
At the same time the north and south direction of this narrow
coastal strip, with its variety of climates, soils, natural resources
and products, brought about a degree of intercourse and mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
reliance of the utmost importance. The mere exchange of the
dried fish and rum of New England, for the sugar, tobacco,
molasses and rice of the southern colonies, paved the way for
an acquaintance and intellectual intercourse necessary to the
development of national spirit. Throughout the colonial
period, the protected coast waters and navigable rivers as far
inland as the "fall line," rendered the problem of long distance
transportation relatively easy. For everything went by water.
Population was compelled to develop the country somewhat
intensively, by reason of the difficulty of westward expansion.
But this population after the Revolution began to press more
and more insistently against the mountain barriers; so that
the need of purely artificial means of transportation at right
angles to the seaboard became ever more apparent.</p>

<p>The period from the Revolution down to 1829, when Stephenson's
"Rocket" made its first successful run between Liverpool
and Manchester, attaining a speed of twenty-nine miles per
hour, was characterized in the United States by increasing
interest in canals and toll roads as means of communication.
As involving less expenditure of capital, the highways were
naturally developed first. In 1756 the first regular stage
between New York and Philadelphia covered the distance in
three days, soon to be followed by the "Flying Machine,"
which made it in two-thirds of that time. Six days were consumed
in the stage trip from New York to Boston. But by
1790 a considerable network of toll roads covered the northern
territory,&mdash;systems which, as in Kentucky by 1840, attained
a length of no less than four hundred miles. Post roads linked
up such remote points as St. Louis, New Orleans, Nashville,
Charleston, and Savannah by 1830. Pennsylvania had made
an early beginning in 1806; and by 1822 had subscribed nearly
two million dollars to fifty-six turnpike companies and wellnigh
a fifth of that sum toward the construction of highway bridges.
Most of these roads throughout the country, however, were
private enterprises, and, even where aided by the state govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>ments,
were imperfectly built and worse maintained, disjointed
and roundabout.</p>

<p>The need of a comprehensive highway system, especially
for the connection of the coastal belt with the Middle West,
early engaged the attention of Congress. Washington seems
to have fully appreciated its importance. Ten dollars a ton
per hundred miles for cost of haulage by road, necessarily
imposed a severe restriction upon the extension of markets.
The Federal Congress in 1802 appropriated one-twentieth of
the proceeds from the sale of Ohio lands to the construction of
such highways. Gallatin's interest in the matter five years
later, led to his proposal of an expenditure of $20,000,000 for
the purpose. The Cumberland Road or "National Pike" was
the result. This great highway started from near the then
centre of population in Maryland and cut across the Middle
West, half-way between the lakes and the Ohio river. From
the upper reaches of the Potomac it followed Braddock's Old
Road to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, then by Wheeling over
"Zanes trace" to Zanesville, Ohio. From that point on it
trended toward St. Louis by way of Columbus and Indianapolis,
ending at Vandalia, Illinois. During the space of thirty
years about $10,000,000 was expended upon it, and it undoubtedly
did much to promote the settlement of the country. But
the success of canals and railroads in the meantime sapped the
vitality of the movement for further turnpike construction
before St. Louis was reached. By the close of the war of 1812,
in fact, it had become apparent that highways were destined
to serve only as feeders after all; and not as main stems of
communication.</p>

<p>Improved riverways and canals constituted the next advance
in transportation method. So far as the latter were concerned,
although the initial expense was great, the subsequent cost of
movement as compared with turnpikes was, of course, low.
Especially was this cheapness of movement notable in river
traffic. Whereas it was said to cost one-third of the worth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
goods to transport them by land from Philadelphia to Kentucky,
the cost of carriage from Illinois down to New Orleans by water
was reputed to equal less than five per cent, of their value.
Hence the steamboat, invented in 1807 and introduced on the
Ohio river in 1811, opened up vast possibilities for enlarged
markets. But it was not until the generation of sufficient
power to stem the rapid river currents about 1817 that our
internal waterways became fully utilized.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From that period
dates the rapid growth of Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and St. Louis.
The real interest of the East in western trade dates from the
close of the war of 1812. Even then, however, the natural
outlet for the products of the strip of newly settled territory
west of the Alleghanies, was still over the mountains to the
Atlantic seaboard. Cotton culture in the South had not yet
given rise to a large demand for food stuffs in the lower Mississippi
valley. It was a long and wellnigh impossible way around
by the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently the main attention of
the people during the canal period between 1816 and 1840 was
focussed upon direct means of communication between the
coastal plain and the interior. A few minor artificial waterways,
like the Middlesex canal from Boston to Lowell, completed
about 1810, proved their entire feasibility from the point
of view both of construction and profit. Even earlier than
this the Dismal Swamp canal and one along the James river in
Virginia had been projected and in part built. But the era of
canal construction as such on a large scale cannot be said to
begin until after the close of the war of 1812. The most important
enterprise, of course, was the building of the Erie
Canal to unite the headwaters of the Hudson river with the
Great Lakes at Buffalo. This waterway, began in 1817, was
completed in eight years and effected a revolution in internal
trade. It was not only successful financially, repaying the
entire construction in ten years, but it at once rendered New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>York the dominant seaport on the Atlantic. Philadelphia was
at once relegated to second place. Agricultural products,
formerly floated down the Susquehanna to Baltimore, now
went directly over the Hudson river route. Branch canals
all over New York state served as feeders; and flourishing
towns sprang up along the way, especially at junction points.
The cost of transportation per ton from Buffalo to New York,
formerly $100, promptly dropped to less than one-fourth that
sum. By wagon it was said to cost $32 per hundred miles for
transport, whereas charges by canal fell to one dollar. Little
wonder that the volume of traffic immensely increased, and
that, moreover, the balance of power among western centres
was at once affected. The future of Chicago, as against St.
Louis, was insured; and the long needed outlet to the sea was
provided for the agricultural products of the prairie West.</p>

<p>The instant and phenomenal success of the Erie Canal
immediately encouraged the prosecution of similar enterprises
elsewhere. Philadelphia pushed the construction of a complicated
chain of horse railroads, canals and portages in order to
reach the Ohio at Pittsburg. In 1834 an entire boat and cargo
made the transit successfully. The cost of this enterprise
exceeded $10,000,000; but it was expected to provide a successful
competitor for the Erie Canal. The latter in the
meantime had been linked up with the Ohio river by canals
from Cleveland to Portsmouth, from Toledo to Cincinnati,
and from Beaver on the Ohio, to Erie on the Lake. By the
first of these routes in 1835, no less than 86,000 barrels of flour,
28,000 bushels of wheat and 2,500,000 staves were carried by
canal on to New York. Boston and Baltimore were prevented
from engaging in similar canal enterprises only by the advent
of the railway. Meantime the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
was started in 1828 as a joint undertaking of Maryland, Virginia,
and the Federal government, to connect the Potomac
with the Ohio. It was not completed in fact until 1850, long
after its potential usefulness had ceased. Besides these through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
routes, canals for the accommodation of local needs were rapidly
built in the East. Boston was connected with Lowell; Worcester
with Providence; New Haven with the Connecticut
river. In Pennsylvania, especially, the anthracite coal industry,
developing after 1815, encouraged the building of artificial
waterways. The Delaware and Hudson, the Schuylkill,
Morris and Lehigh canals were built between 1818 and 1825
along the natural waterways leading out from the hard coal
fields. New Jersey connected New York and Philadelphia by
the Raritan Canal in 1834-1838 at a cost of nearly $5,000,000;
and another canal to connect Delaware and Chesapeake bays
was with difficulty, and only by the aid of the Federal government,
finally completed about 1825 at a cost of nearly $4,000,000.
Further south, many small canals and river improvements
were made. The Dismal Swamp enterprise had already connected
Chesapeake Bay and the coast waters and sounds of
the Carolinas; but provision for slack water navigation of the
Tennessee river at Mussel Shoals in Alabama, and of the
various branches of the Ohio river in Kentucky was not made
until the middle of the thirties.</p>

<p>The open prairies of the West offered the most inviting
prospects for canal construction, both because of the dearth
of roads and the ease of construction of artificial waterways.
Not only through routes to the East, as already described, but
local enterprises of various sorts abounded on every side.
Chicago was connected with the Mississippi system by way of
the Illinois and Michigan Canal; a route across the lower
peninsula of Michigan, and many feeders in Indiana and Ohio
were built. The demands upon the capital of the country for
these purposes during the twenty years after 1815 were enormous;
and it was only by resort to state subventions and
grants from the Federal government out of the proceeds of
sales of public lands, that so much was actually accomplished.
State debts aggregating no less than $60,000,000 for canal
construction were incurred prior to 1837. Much of this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>vestment
proved ultimately unproductive; extravagance and
fraud were rife. But the economic results were immediately
apparent and highly satisfactory, as witnessed in the higher
prices obtainable for all the products of the interior for transportation
to the seaboard. Flour, which could be had at three
dollars a barrel at Cincinnati in 1826, rose to double that
figure by 1835; and corn rose from twelve to thirty-two cents
a bushel. The panic of 1837 and the subsequent depression,
of course, put a severe check upon further canal building. But
an even more potent force was the proved success of the newly
invented mode of carriage by railroad. Before 1840 the era
of canal construction was definitely at an end. Almost the
only exception was the Erie Canal, which continued to prosper
by reason of its strategic location. Rates were reduced in 1834;
and two years later the canal was widened and deepened to
accommodate the ever increasing traffic. Surplus revenues
enabled the amortization of its debt; and by 1852 the revenue
exceeded three million dollars annually. Although the pressure
of railway competition was increasingly felt; as late as 1868,
practically all the grain into New York was brought by canal
barge. The movement of this canal tonnage, year by year,
is shown by the diagram on page <a href="#Page_25">25</a>. As will be seen, it was
not until the trunk line rate wars of 1874-1877 that the inferiority
of the canal to the railroad, even in this favored instance,
was finally demonstrated. The revival of interest in
the Erie Canal which has occurred in recent years, leading to
the expenditure of millions of dollars by the state of New York
in still further enlarging it, is due to an effort to insure the
supremacy of the port of New York in export trade against the
growing competition of the Gulf ports, which it originally
gained when the canal was constructed.</p>

<p>The first serious attempt at railroad operation in the United
States was on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio line in 1830. The company,
although chartered in 1821, did not begin construction for
seven years. It was three years later than this when Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Cooper's "Tom Thumb" made a trial run out from Baltimore
with a record of thirteen miles per hour. A road from
Albany to Schenectady was opened in 1831; and a series of
connecting links was rapidly pushed westward across New York
state, finally reaching Buffalo in 1842. But prior to 1840,
activity in railroad construction was most noticeable in Pennsylvania:
partly because of its lack of so admirable a water
route to connect it with inland markets as was enjoyed by New
York, and partly because of the growth of the coal business
which caused the main lines of the Reading Railroad to be laid
down as early as 1838. The state of Pennsylvania was busily
engaged in improving her existing route over the mountains
by replacing the canal and portage portions with rail lines.
Pittsburg, which formerly had been five and a half days distant,
was thus connected by railroad in 1834. Cars built
in the form of boat sections were to be transferred from the
rails to canals along part of this route. The Pennsylvania
Railroad aiming to provide continuous railway communication
over the mountains, was not chartered until 1846; but, nevertheless,
as early as 1835 Pennsylvania had over two hundred
miles of railway, about one-quarter of the mileage of the United
States. New York and New Jersey had about one hundred
miles between them, while South Carolina had one hundred
and thirty-seven miles. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio during this
time was being slowly pushed westward; although it did not
reach the Ohio river until 1853, two years after the Erie had,
by liberal state aid, been carried to the lakes at Dunkirk, N.Y.
Thus it appears that during the decade to 1840 railroad building
had progressed unchecked by the panic of 1837. This
panic, in fact, by rendering the state construction of canals
impossible, may actually have increased the interest in railroad
building. The railways of this time were still mainly experimental.
They were local and disconnected, serving rather as
supplementary to, than as actual competitors of the existing
water routes. In Massachusetts and Connecticut the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
radiating out from seaports were intended to serve only as
feeders to coastwise traffic; just as short lines were built along
the Great Lakes during the decade to 1850 to bring products out
to a connection with the natural water routes. A notable
exception was the continuous line which by 1840 was in operation
lengthwise of the Atlantic coast plain from New York
south to Wilmington, North Carolina. The Camden and
Amboy between Philadelphia and New York was operated
early in the thirties; about the same time that the Philadelphia,
Wilmington &amp; Baltimore was completed. Much interesting
history centres about the first named road. It seems
to have been a notoriously corrupting influence in New Jersey
politics from the outset. Public opinion became so roused over
its exactions, that a memorial from the merchants of New York
to the Thirtieth Congress resulted. The enterprise was the most
profitable of all the earlier companies, its net earnings in 1840
amounting to $427,000. In 1855 it paid a twelve per cent.
dividend. From Washington south by way of Fredericksburg
and Richmond, the southern states could be reached without
undertaking the perilous passage round Cape Hatteras. By
1840 the only portions of the original colonies still isolated
were New England, at one end, which was still obliged to depend
upon Long Island transit to New York by boat; and
in the Far South, the back country behind Charleston and

<p>Several important economic causes conspired to stimulate
railroad construction at a very early time in the southern states.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
They welcomed the new means of transportation even more
eagerly than the wealthier, commercial and more densely
populated North. Ever since the invention of the gin in 1793,
the production of cotton had grown apace. Profits were so
high that all interest in other forms of agriculture waned.
Cotton production until about 1817 was mainly confined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>the long narrow strip of Piedmont territory, lying between the
sandy "pine barrens" along the coast and the mountains in
the rear. This fertile strip&mdash;the seat of the plantation system&mdash;thus
geographically isolated, had only one means of
communication with the outer world, namely the coast rivers
debouching upon the sea at Charleston, Savannah, or, later on,
upon the Gulf at Mobile. But these seaports were not conveniently
situated to serve as local trade centres. They were
separated from the cotton belt by the intervening pine barrens.
The local business of buying the cotton from the planters, and in
return supplying their imperative needs for supplies of all
sorts, including even foodstuffs which they neglected to raise,
was concentrated in a series of towns located at the so-called
"fall line" of the rivers. From Alexandria and Richmond on
the Potomac and James, round by Augusta, Macon, and
Columbia to Montgomery, Alabama, such local centres of
importance arose, each one just at the head of navigation.
For some years profits were so large that heavy charges for
transportation to the sea were patiently borne. But after the
opening of the western cotton belt along the Mississippi bottom
lands after 1817, the price of cotton experienced a severe
decline, greatly to the distress of the older planters. For this
reason an insistent demand for improved means of transportation
had already brought about great interest in turnpike and
canal building. South Carolina at a very early date had expended
about two million dollars for these purposes. Steamboats
on the smaller rivers were also used. Immediately upon
the successful demonstration of traction by steam the aid of
the states, cities and individuals was invoked; so that a well
planned system of railroads resulted even as early as 1843.
The South Carolina Railroad between 1829 and 1833 most
successfully operated a pioneer line, its securities being quoted
at twenty-five per cent. above par. The Charleston &amp; Hamburg
line opened in 1833, one hundred and thirty-seven miles
long, was said to be the largest system under one management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in the world. Augusta &amp; Columbia were linked up with the
coast. Savannah also penetrated inland to the Piedmont belt
by a line finished in 1843 as far as Macon. The interest in a
through route to connect Cincinnati and Louisville with Charleston
was very keen; and had it not been for the tremendous fall
in cotton prices in 1839-1840, the project might have succeeded.
As it was, a great railroad convention at Knoxville in 1836
was attended by no less than four hundred delegates from nine
different states. It was not so much the mileage of these roads
which rendered them notable, as the fact of their intended
reliance upon through freight instead of passenger business.
Roads in other parts of the country were as yet depending in
the main upon passenger traffic or upon the carriage of what
we would now call local or parcel freight. These southern
lines were built to accommodate traffic in great staple agricultural
products&mdash;cotton out and foodstuffs in. Unlike
the northern roads, also, they early adopted a uniform gauge
and sought to promote long distance business. Later developments
in the South especially in the direction of improved
service were very slow. The northern states speedily outstripped
them; but the enterprise of this region in railroad
building and operation at the outset has not been fully
appreciated.</p>

<p>The decade 1840-1850 was marked by slow growth of the
railway net,&mdash;everywhere except in New England, where
the main lines were being rapidly laid down. The doom of the
canal as a competitor had been sealed, to be sure; but the
dearth of private capital, except in New England, rendered
progress slow until aid from the government was invoked.
Until this time private enterprise had been the main reliance.
Several important undertakings were now launched. The
Pennsylvania Railroad was chartered in 1846, but was not
completed to Pittsburg till 1852. The Boston &amp; Albany line
was built; and Buffalo had been reached. But neither the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio, nor the Erie had yet been pushed to com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>pletion.
The possibilities of the great Northwest had not
dawned upon the people. At the opening of the decade, St.
Louis was still almost three times as large as Chicago. Cincinnati
was the most important western centre, its prestige
being enhanced by the first all-rail line to the Great Lakes at
Sandusky, opened in 1848. The relative importance of these
inland centres is indicated by their populations. In 1850 these
were as follows: Cincinnati, 115,000; Chicago, 30,000; St.
Louis, 78,000; and Louisville, 43,000. Cincinnati retained
its pre&euml;minence until after the Civil War; but by 1880 had
dropped to a low third in rank, only half the size of Chicago
and two-thirds the size of St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> During the decade to
1850, the Ann Arbor line from Detroit also was pushed on to
Chicago in 1852, to cut off the roundabout trip by lake;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but
St. Louis was still isolated; Indianapolis was barely connected
with the Ohio river. The river trade thus still dominated
the western situation. In the South one important enterprise
monopolized all attention, namely the construction by the
state of Georgia of the Western &amp; Atlantic road over the
mountains from Atlanta to Chattanooga on the Tennessee
river.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Atlanta was to become the western terminus of the
coast roads, built, as has been said, to provide an outlet to the
sea for the Piedmont cotton belt. This new enterprise was to
open up a direct route, not alone to the new western South but
to the entire Northwest by connecting with a navigable
branch of the Ohio. It is an odd fact that at this time the
southern ports were nearer the West than the cities of the
North Atlantic. Part of the first rush of the Forty-niners to
California was by way of Charleston and thence west over the
Charleston &amp; Hamburg line. From 1837 on, the Western &amp;
Atlantic line was under construction. In the meantime Atlanta
had been reached from the east; so that at the beginning of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>next decade, two at least of the main arteries of the southern
net were ready for business.</p>

<p>The total mileage of the United States expanded in ten
years after 1840 from 2,800 to upwards of 9,000 miles of line.
For some time not over four or five hundred miles annually
had been constructed; but suddenly the new mileage laid
down in 1848 jumped to more than fourteen hundred miles.
This was a presage of the great expansion to occur in the next
few years,&mdash;an expansion made possible partly as a result of
important mechanical improvements and inventions. Notable
among these was the substitution of the solid iron rail for the
primitive method of plating beams with thin strips of iron.
The manufacture of rails in the United States, begun in 1844,
did much to stimulate the subsequent growth. The repeal
of the law of 1832 permitting free entry of railway iron which
took place in 1843, marks the beginning of a new era. During
these eleven years almost five million dollars in duties on rails
was refunded.</p>

<p>The utmost activity in railroad building obtained from
1848 until the panic of 1857, interrupted only by a minor
disturbance in 1854. The total mileage expanded more than
threefold, attaining a total of 30,000 miles by 1860. A veritable
construction mania prevailed in the states of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois. Not very much, relatively, was accomplished
in New York and Pennsylvania, and very little in New
England, which was already well served. A dominant influence
in promoting the new construction at this time was the imperative
need of the South for foodstuffs. Cotton culture was
in full swing in the lowlands of Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana. An enormous steam and flat boat tonnage on the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers had grown up to care for this trade.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
By 1845 the river shipping amounted to nearly two million
tons. Fifteen hundred out of four thousand steamboat
arrivals at New Orleans in 1859, came from the Ohio river and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>the upper Mississippi. The vessels had also greatly increased
in size. The flat boats which in 1820 carried only thirty tons
of freight, were enlarged tenfold in tonnage and threefold in
length by 1855, and in that year first began to be towed back
up the river. A rapid increase in coal shipments down stream
from Pittsburg also took place during the forties. From 737,000
bushels in 1844, to 22,000,000 bushels in 1855 and 37,900,000
in 1860, represents an enormous development of internal
commerce. The lead mines of Missouri shipping through St.
Louis had become important after 1832 and quadrupled in
volume by 1848, attaining a total of 42,400,000 pigs of sixty
pounds each. This traffic steadily dwindled, however, falling
away by one half within the next ten years. Memphis was
rapidly growing, outstripping the city of Natchez which had
formerly played a more important part in the southern trade.
But the most important element in this Mississippi river business
was the shipment down stream of food stuffs. Produce
received at New Orleans was valued at $26,000,000 in 1830,
$50,000,000 in 1841, and $185,000,000 in 1860. About thirty
per cent. of this consisted of farm produce from the Northwest,
together with horses, mules, implements, and clothing. The
need of ampler transportation facilities to accommodate all
this business was apparent. A response came in plans for new
north and south lines of railway. The difficulty of financing
these enterprises was solved in part by the expedient of land
grants by the different states. These amounted to no less
than eight million acres under President Fillmore, attaining a
total of nineteen million acres under the Pierce administration.
By 1861 these grants, mainly in aid of railroads, had reached
a total of no less than 31,600,842 acres,&mdash;more than equal to
the area of either of the states of Ohio, or New York.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
Illinois Central grant in 1851 was the largest among these.
Congress in 1850 had made over a tract of 2,700,000 acres to
the state of Illinois to be used for this purpose. This gift was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>soon followed elsewhere by grants to aid the building of the
Mobile &amp; Ohio and the Mississippi Central, together with
smaller roads in Alabama and Florida. The Gulf of Mexico
was thus reached by through lines from the west in 1858-1861.
In other parts of the country railroads were pushed well out in
advance of population. The Mississippi was reached by the
Rock Island system in 1854, quickly followed by the Alton,
the Burlington and the predecessor of the present Northwestern
system. The Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph was the first to reach
the Missouri river in 1858. There is no doubt that the discovery
of gold in California greatly stimulated interest in all
these far western enterprises.</p>

<p>Despite this remarkable record of growth, a corresponding
development of long-distance communication between different
parts of the country had not yet taken place. While the all-rail
routes were open, they still consisted in large part of disconnected
local lines. The New York Central with difficulty
in 1853, and in spite of intense local opposition, succeeded in
effecting a consolidation of what were originally eleven separate
lines; but the union with the Hudson River Railroad was not
to follow until 1869. The Boston &amp; Albany was still a local
enterprise, although built with larger ends in view. At this
time the possibility of long-distance carriage of grain was only
very dimly appreciated. Fast freight lines to operate without
breaking bulk over independent roads, constituted the first
step in this direction. Such companies on the New York
Central in 1855 and on the Erie two years later, were operating
in the eastern trunk territory. The so-called Green lines were
engaging in long distance business by way of Ohio river connections
between the territory to the northwest and the great
grain and pork consuming cotton belt. But railroad traffic
as a whole was still relatively unimportant as compared with
water carriage. The culmination of steadily increasing receipts
on the Erie Canal did not occur until 1856. River tonnage
went on steadily increasing for another twenty years. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
years just before the war seem to have marked the turning
point in respect of canal competition; but the total volume of
railroad shipments, nevertheless, still appears insignificant by
comparison with the present day. The total traffic in 1859
on the Pennsylvania Railroad was only 353,000 tons east bound
and 190,700 tons west bound; while on the New York Central
it was 570,900 and 263,400 tons, respectively. The important
point was that the cost of shipment was steadily declining.
According to H. C. Carey, the passenger rate from Chicago to
New York had fallen from about seventy-five dollars to seventeen
dollars in 1850; while the freight rate per bushel on wheat
had fallen to twenty-seven cents; and per barrel of flour to
eighty cents. Nothing but the development of a large surplus
production in the West was needed to create a great traffic;
and this was dependent upon the spread of population and
improvements in agricultural production which had not yet
occurred. Transportation as yet waited upon the progress of
invention; not in instruments of transportation alone, but in
all the other fields of industrial endeavor.</p>

<p>The panic of 1857 and the increasing bitterness of the
slavery question, followed by the outbreak of the Civil War,
quite diverted the attention of the country from internal
development. Railroad construction had already declined
from 3,600 miles in 1856 to 1,837 miles in 1860. It fell to
less than 700 miles in 1861. Brisk recovery set in after
1865; but it was not until 1868 that any rapid growth again
ensued, or even a resumption of the activity of the preceding
decade. All of the southern lines were prostrated; the north
and south roads, like the Illinois Central system, stood still.
The western railway net alone was slowly expanding. The
Burlington grew from 168 miles in 1861 to over 400 miles in 1865;
and the Chicago &amp; Northwestern then succeeded in bridging
the Mississippi. The Erie was still a more important route
by fifty per cent., measured by ton mileage, than the New York
Central; although its evil days, under the control of Jim Fiske<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and Jay Gould in 1866-1869, were about to begin. The Mecca
of trade from the Atlantic ports was still St. Louis, although
Chicago outgrew it during the decade. The predominant
direction of trade is shown by the widespread public interest in
New York in the newly opened Western &amp; Atlantic railroad,
which by a spur from the Erie road at Salamanca, was to
shorten the time of shipment of goods from New York to Cincinnati
from one month to a week. The commercial star of
New York was steadily rising. A great aid thereto was, of
course, the progress of consolidation among the connecting
links to Chicago. Vanderbilt and Scott were busily engaged
in this constructive work. The former had shifted his interest
from steamboats to railroads, and became dominant in the
Harlem and Hudson River roads in 1863-1864. Three years
later he secured control of the New York Central from Albany
west, and consolidated it with the Hudson River line. These
trunk line roads, the Pennsylvania and the New York Central,
both finally secured connections with Chicago in 1869. A
channel for new through currents of trade merely awaited the
growth of business.</p>

<p>It is important to realize the relative primitiveness of
transportation at the close of the Civil War.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Bessemer
steel process was not perfected until the latter half of the decade.<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Iron rails still rendered light rolling stock necessary. But after
1868 the price of steel rails rapidly declined, from about $166
(currency) per ton in 1867 to $112 in 1872, and to $59 in 1876.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
This doubtless gave a tremendous impetus to the developments
of later years, although its effects were not evident for some
time. One of the most troublesome features of the time were
the differences of gauge which rendered through traffic difficult.
In New York and New England, the standard gauge was four
feet eight and one-half inches. West and south of Philadelphia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>it was four feet ten inches. In the Far South it was five feet;
and in Canada and Maine, either five feet six inches or six feet.
Between Chicago and Buffalo five different roads still had no
common gauge. Clumsy expedients of shifting car trucks,
three rails or extra wide wheel flanges were adopted. Even as
late as 1876 Albert Fink refers to the celerity with which trucks
could be changed at junction points, not over ten minutes being
requisite.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The first double tracking in the country, that of
the New York Central, was not accomplished until the war
period. There was not even a bridge over the Hudson at
Albany until 1866, and no bridge at St. Louis, although the
Northwestern had bridged the Mississippi higher up. No
night trains were run generally. No export grain trade existed,
although feeble beginnings had been apparent at New York
for some years. Philadelphia did not even have a trunk line
as late as the end of the war; and neither Boston nor Philadelphia
had regular steamer lines to Europe. For the great
staples of trade, the canals and rivers were largely utilized.
The Erie Canal during the war, took twice as much freight as
the Erie and New York Central together. Even in 1865 the
ton mileage of the Erie Canal&mdash;844,000,000&mdash;compared
with a ton mileage of 265,000,000 for the New York Central
and 388,000,000 for the Erie Railroad. And in 1872, eighty-five
per cent of the freight between New York and Philadelphia
still went by water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Railroad construction during the next decade to 1880 was
extremely active. East of the Mississippi developments were
confined in the main to building branches and feeders. One
new through line in the East was opened, by the entrance of
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio into New York in 1873 and into Chicago
in the following year. Another important enterprise was the
building of the Air Line route to connect Atlanta with Richmond
by a road traversing the fertile Piedmont belt. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
completion by the state of Massachusetts of the Hoosac Tunnel
line, providing a new outlet to the west from Boston, was also a
notable achievement. This route was at last opened in 1874
after a painful experience extending over twenty years, involving
an expenditure by the state of about $17,000,000. Most of
the new railroad building of the seventies took place in the upper
Mississippi valley. The states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,
(eastern) Nebraska and Kansas were rapidly gridironed with
new lines. Much of this construction took place after 1868,
activity culminating in 1871 with the building of no less than
7,379 miles of line. The panic of 1873 put an end to all this,
except in California where expansion went on unabated. Nearly
one thousand miles of new line were added to the systems
of this state during the five years to 1878,&mdash;nearly doubling
its mileage during this period. Elsewhere in the country little
was accomplished during the protracted hard times. In 1875,
for instance, only seventeen hundred miles were constructed.
This cessation of development did not change for the better
until the resumption of general prosperity in 1878. The net
result of ten years building was, nevertheless, considerable,
represented by an expansion from 53,000 to upwards of 93,000
miles of line. Railroad building, in fact, increased about two
and one-half times as fast as population. So that by 1880
the United States was already more amply furnished with
transportation mileage than any country in Europe.</p>

<p>Among the important events to be associated with this
period was the opening of the first transcontinental route,
marked by the joining of the Union and Central Pacific railroads
in 1869. The history of its construction under liberal
land grants from the Federal government belongs in another
place. Aside from the political effect, the economic results
were immediate. Population at once flowed over onto the
Pacific slope. And a large volume of trade was at once deflected
from the sea route round Cape Horn. The value of goods
shipped by water between New York and San Francisco, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in 1869 amounted to $70,000,000, fell in the next year to
$18,600,000, and in 1872 to less than $10,000,000. The success
of the enterprise, together with growing interest in the
Pacific states, doubtless led to the opening of construction of
the Northern Pacific as a transcontinental route in 1870.</p>

<p>The rapid development of an export trade in grain to Europe
between 1870 and 1874 was a direct result of improvements in
agriculture and the opening up of a surplus grain-producing
area. As yet this territory lay mainly east and south of Chicago.
Even as late as 1882, over four-fifths of the eastbound
trunk line traffic originated not further west than Illinois.
Wisconsin and Iowa contributed less than ten per cent. of this
business. The methods of handling wheat were still quite
primitive. During the Civil War thousands of men were
employed to unload the grain by hand, every tenth barrel
being weighed. Elevators had been used in Chicago for some
time but no eastern city had them until 1861. Prior to 1872,
when the first grain elevator was set up at Baltimore, the cost of
thus unloading grain by hand amounted to four or five cents
per bushel. At Boston until 1867, all the export grain was still
unloaded back of the city and hauled across to the waterfront.</p>

<p>The volume of exportable surplus products of the country
rose rapidly after 1870. An increase from five or six bushels
of wheat production <i>per capita</i> in 1860, to nearly nine bushels
in 1879, left a large margin for foreign sale. The growth of
such traffic, big with importance for the carriers, is indicated
by the opposite diagram. The large total of 59,000,000
bushels of wheat and (equivalent) wheat flour reached in 1862,
partly as a result of the closing of markets in the southern
states, was not again surpassed for more than a decade. The
most notable increase ensued after 1873, when the level rose
about fifty per cent., to become established thereafter upon a
permanently higher plane. A second sudden boost occurred
again in 1877 when wheat exports rose rapidly to a total of
180,000,000 bushels within three years. The disastrous failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of European crops in 1879, with a coincident bumper yield in
the United States, led to the immediate climax of the movement
in 1881. These exports, moreover, which fifty years earlier,
owing to the cost of carriage, were almost exclusively in the
form of flour, were now in 1880 about three-fourths constituted
of raw wheat. Examination of the diagram with its steep
pyramid of development at this time is convincing as to the
stimulus thereby given to the railway interests. Foreign trade
in cattle and beef products also enormously increased during
these years. In 1876 only 244 steers were exported, while in
1877, 71,794, and in 1881, 134,000 head were shipped abroad.
The value of preserved meats exported quadrupled in one year
after 1877, and grew eightfold by 1880. Doubtless part of
this disposition of products abroad during the seventies was
due to a cessation of demand at home owing to the prevalent
hard times; but the important discovery was incidentally
made that the demand abroad existed, and merely required
cheap transportation for its successful development.</p>

<p>The second step necessary for permanently developing railroad
business was a lowering of the charges. This was first
brought about during the seventies through unregulated com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>petition
between the trunk lines. The fiercest warfare occurred
during the years immediately following the entrance of the Baltimore
and Ohio and the Grand Trunk railroads into Chicago in
1874. This was some five years after the Pennsylvania and the
New York Central had consolidated their through lines to the
same point. These two original rivals had already slashed
rates indiscriminately. Charges of $1.88 and 82 cents for first-and
fourth-class freight from Chicago to New York in 1868,
had already for a brief period in the following year dropped to
a uniform rate of twenty-five cents for all business. As Hadley
justly observes, such rates could not long prevail; and for the
next few years nominal rates of one dollar, and one dollar and
fifty cents for first class, and sixty and eighty cents for fourth
class obtained. The outbreak of open warfare between the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Pennsylvania over the charges made
by the latter for the use of its lines between Philadelphia and
New York, occurred in 1874. Grain rates of sixty cents per
hundred pounds from Chicago to New York during 1873 fell
to forty cents in 1874 and to thirty cents in 1875. Special or
commodity rates were often as low as twelve cents. After a
year's truce, only partially observed by the leading participants,
discord again prevailed during 1876. The commercial rivalries
of seaboard cities now became involved. Different or specially
favorable rates had been accorded to Baltimore and Philadelphia
as compared with New York since 1869.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Rates
finally fell lower than ever before. This was especially true of
grain. The published rate in March, 1876, was forty-five cents
per hundred pounds from Chicago to New York. In May it
fell to twenty cents&mdash;a rate almost as low as prevails today
with all modern improvements in methods of conducting the
business. Westbound rates dropped correspondingly. Quotations
from New York to Chicago at twenty-five cents per
hundred pounds first class, and sixteen cents fourth class were
freely given. Actual rates were often much lower than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Rival cities again intervened and finally the whole matter was
of necessity referred for arbitration to a commission. Even
then both the Erie and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio roads were well
advanced on the road to bankruptcy. For us, however, the
immediate result of importance was a permanent reduction
of the general level of freight rates, not alone for the trunk line
territory but for the entire country. The diagram on page <a href="#Page_413">413</a>
shows this plainly. From an average revenue per ton of freight
moved one mile of 1.92 cents in 1868, intermittently upheld
until 1872, the fall of over one-third to about 1.1 cents in 1882
was sudden and continuous. The end was not yet. The
renewed outbreak of a rate war between the trunk lines in 1881
and again in 1884 led to further reductions. The decision in
1882 of the Thurman Commission on Differentials settled
nothing.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> All kinds of traffic were affected. Immigrants were
carried from New York to Chicago for $1.00 a head. East-bound
grain rates were as low as eight cents. At last, late in
1885, the warfare was terminated by an elaborate pooling
agreement. These struggles brought about great reductions
in the revenue of the carriers concerned; but declines in rates
after this period were, in the main, more gradual, with short
intervals of relief interspersed.</p>

<p>One immediate result of these lower freight rates was the
impetus given to economy and systematic operation. This is
the period when, as we have said, pooling as a device for restraint
of competition first appeared in the "Evening" contracts
on beef shipments in the West, in the notable
Southern Railway &amp; Steamship Association in 1874 and
in the trunk line pool in 1877. Agreement between the
anthracite coal roads began about 1872 and has continued
with increasing effectiveness ever since.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This was also the
heyday of the through freight lines which were now operating
from every important western centre. In 1876 the
first attempt at a systematic scheme of rate adjustment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>between competing localities was made in trunk line
territory.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Order was indeed emerging out of chaos. In
respect of operation, larger locomotives and cars and longer
trains were rapidly coming into use. On the Lake Shore the
average train load in 1870 was 137 tons. Nine years later it
had risen to 213 tons. The widespread substitution of steel
for iron rails was not yet to follow for some time. For in 1880
only three-tenths of the mileage of the country was laid with
steel. This proportion rose to eight-tenths in 1890. It was
doubtless this change during the eighties which made possible
the heavy decrease in operating expenses which occurred
during the five years subsequent to 1881. It appears, indeed, as
if the need of economy was enforced by the decline of rates in
progress; but, as usual, the supply of economies waited upon
the demand and, in fact, tarried well behind it. To this circumstance
may be attributed some of the financial hardships
suffered by the roads during the ensuing interval between the
reduction of rates during the seventies and the mechanical improvements
of the succeeding decade. An incidental result of
the rate wars of this period, it may also be noted, was the readjustment
of the relative shares of the great seaports in foreign
business. Philadelphia, especially, increased its quota of
exports from about eleven per cent, in 1860 to over twenty
per cent. in 1880. Much of this was gained, however, from the
southern ports, as the relative status of Baltimore, New York,
and Boston remained about the same.</p>

<p>A second important consequence of the severe decline in
railroad rates during the seventies, was the permanent supersession
of canals and riverways in favor of railroads as means
of transportation. The Erie Canal outlasted all the other
artificial water routes, most of which had succumbed to rail
competition by the close of the Civil War. But even as late
as 1868, practically all of the grain arriving at New York came
by canal. The change, when it occurred, came suddenly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>FREIGHT RECEIPTS
AT
NEW YORK</p></div>
</div>

<p>No canal could meet the fierce slashing of rates which suddenly
supervened on the rail lines. Since 1855, when the canal
carried twice the traffic of all the trunk lines, until 1861-1862
when the rail and water lines were about even, the railroads
had steadily gained in tonnage.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The turning point was
reached in 1872 when the canal traffic actually began to decline.
Between 1871 and 1876 the aggregate tonnage (both ways) on
the New York canals fell away about half, spasmodically
recovered during the great expansion of exports in 1879-1880,
held constant for five years, and thereafter steadily dwindled
away. As the accompanying diagram shows, the rise of railroad
tonnage was rapid up to 1873. Thereafter for several
years during the actual panic, despite the railroad wars and
low rates, no great change occurred. But by 1876, eighty-three
per cent. of all-grain receipts at Atlantic ports came by
rail; and over nine-tenths of all the commerce between East
and West had left the water routes. At New York the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>main railroads carried six times the traffic of all the state canals
in 1880. After that time the canal barges were loaded only
with coal, lime, sand, cement, and similar low-grade traffic.
So that in the rapid expansion of business, which, as our diagram
shows, occurred after 1878, the canal shared not at all.
The disparity between east-and westbound tonnage was notably
great. In 1870 this eastbound traffic was about three
times as great as the tonnage west bound. In 1881 it was
seven and one-half times as great, declining thereafter to a
proportion of about 6.5 to 1 during the late nineties. This
inequality, of course, whetted the appetite of the carriers for
back loads to fill the westbound trains, and undoubtedly
gave an impetus to rate disturbance. The rate wars led by
the New York Central during 1881 were largely due to this
fact.</p>

<p>As for water carriage elsewhere, the rivers soon followed
the canals in steady decline of relative importance. On the
southern streams, such as the Cumberland and Tennessee, the
principal diversion to the railroads of traffic in foodstuffs
south bound from the West, took place in the five years subsequent
to 1866.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> High-water mark in the Mississippi trade was
reached in 1879, the year of the completion of the jetties for
the improvement of navigation at the mouth of the river. A
steady decline thereafter has ensued down to the present day.
New Orleans had then only recently engaged in foreign trade
in grain. Exports of wheat and flour (equivalent) had suddenly
risen from less than 1,000,000 bushels in 1875 to over
12,000,000 bushels in 1880. At this time this came principally
by river. It was nearly ten years later before the Illinois
Central actively engaged in such export business. But when
the railroads finally seized upon it, the river trade was doomed.
The only exception to this decrease of inland water transportation
occurred on the Great Lakes. The carriage of coal, iron
ore, and lumber rapidly increased. Through the Detroit river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>the tonnage grew from 9,000,000 in 1873 to 20,000,000 tons
in 1880; and through the St. Mary's Canal from 403,000 in
1860 to 1,734,000 tons in 1880. Inasmuch as a fair proportion
of this rapidly growing business was ultimately destined to reach
the seaboard either as raw material or in the form of manufactures,
this water traffic contributed to, rather than lessened
the prosperity of the trunk lines operating east of the lakes.</p>

<p>The growing importance of railroads during the seventies
was accompanied by collateral developments, which deserve
mention in a general preliminary survey. The abuses of personal
discrimination and favoritism, constantly recurring rate
wars and disturbances, the financial scandals of construction
companies and subsidiary corporations, the frauds perpetrated
by unscrupulous financiers like Gould and Fiske, coupled with
the arrogance of railroad managements, aroused widespread
public hostility. This led to an insistent demand for public
regulation and control. The Granger movement formed its
open expression in the western states. The searching inquiries
of the famous Hepburn Committee of the New York legislature
in 1879 voiced it in the East. The Windom report of 1874
was called forth on behalf of the Federal government. The
first railroad commission, that of Massachusetts in 1869, was
soon followed by others all over the country. And a campaign
of education was set under way which finally led to the Federal
inquiries of the Cullom Committee of 1886 and the Federal
Act to Regulate Commerce of the following year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The decade of the eighties, so far as common carriers are
concerned, was primarily characterized by new railroad construction.
Over 70,000 miles of line were built in ten years,&mdash;a
mileage just about equal to the total new construction for
both the ten preceding and the ten following years combined.
The movement culminated in 1882, and again in 1887, in two
veritable crazes of promotion and speculative activity, unequalled
before or since in our railroad history. The first was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
suddenly stopped by a short, sharp railroad panic in 1884.
Jay Gould's operations in Union and Kansas Pacific set a pace
for manipulation and fraud, which could have no other sequel.
The second craze was doubtless in part restrained by the moral
effect of the passage in 1887 of the Act to Regulate Commerce;
although, viewed in a larger way, it was more directly due to
the exhaustion both of the supply of capital and of confidence
among investors. These two outbreaks of railroad promotion
are deserving of further comment, both by reason of their
extent and character. Prior to 1880, new railroads constructed
had averaged a little over two thousand miles annually. The
figures for 1881-1882, respectively, were 6,711 and 9,846 miles,
rising finally to a total of 11,569 miles in 1882. This record
has never been surpassed but once: when, four years later at
the height of the second "boom," 12,983 miles of new line were
laid down. A large part of this building was in the Far West
and Southwest, these regions being now opened up as the upper
Mississippi valley had been developed between 1868 and the
panic of 1873. A second transcontinental route was opened
in 1881, through the joining of the Southern Pacific and Atchison
Topeka and Santa Fe roads at Deming and El Paso.
Within two years thereafter two direct routes to connect the
Southern Pacific system with New Orleans were completed.
The Pacific Northwest was admitted to rail connection with
the rest of the country in 1883-1884, by two significant events.
The Northern Pacific road was then opened, and the Oregon
Short line to connect the Columbia river basin with the Union
Pacific system. The Great Northern road reached the Pacific
slope in the year 1893, accompanied by the Canadian Pacific,
constructed just over the border. This activity in far western
railroad building was mainly due to the growth of the
Pacific slope; but it was also favored by the successful competition
of railways with the water routes round Cape Horn. It was
estimated that as late as 1878, not over one quarter of the total
tonnage moved into California went by rail. But the railroads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
then inaugurated a system of special contracts by which shippers
who agreed to use the railroads exclusively, were given
considerably reduced rates. By 1884 when the plan was discontinued,
the percentage of tonnage carried to California by rail
rose from twenty-five to between sixty and seventy-five percent.
In the eastern states, the eighties was the period of speculative
"parallelling" of existing lines of road, in order to dragoon
the older lines into purchasing the new ones at extortionate
prices. This was done under the guise of affording satisfaction
to the popular outcry for competition as a means of reducing
rates. Two notable instances were the building of the West
Shore road, paralleling the New York Central; and of the
Nickel Plate line which similarly ran for miles within a few rods
of the Lake Shore across northern Ohio. The fact was that
the prolonged period of depression during the seventies had
brought about an accumulation of surplus capital awaiting
investment. The rapid repayment of its debt by the United
States government, also released a large supply of funds.
General prosperity prevailed and prices were everywhere
rising. This increase of prices, extending from commodities
to all issues of stocks and bonds, reduced the rate of return
upon investment for these new supplies of capital in all the
older enterprises. The only alternative, in seeking for a
liberal return on investments, was to risk it in new ventures.
Speculation ran riot. All sorts of projects were eagerly taken
up, and among these, new railroads were most important.
They were freely built, far in advance of population in the
West or of prospective needs for enlargement in the East, not
so much sometimes to develop the country, as to enrich the
promoters. That they ultimately served the public interest
was not the main concern in too many instances. This was
also the heyday of the fraudulent construction company,
already so ably utilized by the builders of the Pacific roads.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, speculation in every conceivable form ran riot in a
way not repeated thereafter for nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>Aside from rampant speculation, American railroad history
during the eighties must record various other economic events
of importance. The city of New York and the New York
Central Railroad were at the culmination of their relative
importance in the export trade of the country. The volume
of eastbound tonnage was enormous in the early eighties. In
1881, 2,500,000 tons of freight east bound were carried by the
New York Central alone, a figure surpassed in only two years
until 1896. Another event of importance was the general
westward drift of population and agriculture. This was accompanied
by a corresponding migration of manufactures inland
from the Atlantic seaboard. The lines from the Central West
to the South, such as the Illinois Central and the Cincinnati,
New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific road, had formerly relied almost
entirely upon the carriage of grain or flour and packing-house
products from the farms of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to the
cotton-raising South. During the latter half of the eighties
they carried an ever increasing proportion of manufactured
goods, such as boots and shoes, clothing, wooden ware, harnesses
and groceries,&mdash;in fact everything denoted by the words general
merchandise. More and more the supplies of grain, flour and
packing-house products were being produced in Iowa, Nebraska,
and Kansas, while larger quantities of general merchandise
originated in the Middle West. The result was a
need for new diagonal trunk lines from such points as Kansas
City and Omaha into the lower Mississippi valley. The decline
of Cincinnati as a great pork-packing centre dates from this
time. Memphis and Vicksburg derived a new importance
at the junction of such lines as the Kansas City, Memphis &amp;
Birmingham with the older Mississippi river roads. At about
this time, in 1889, also, occurred the opening of the Gulf ports
for the export of the surplus grain products of the territory
west of the Mississippi. The significance of this for the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
trunk lines did not appear until later; but the occurrence forms
a part of that westward trend of population above mentioned.
These years were all characterized by the increasing importance
of long-distance through business, as distinguished from mere
local trade. The markets of the country as a whole, the areas
of commercial competition, were steadily expanding. Viewed
in a large way, it was doubtless this economic phenomenon which
at this time emphasized the need of centralized Federal control,
instead of state regulation, if control there were to be. This
found its expression in the passage by Congress of the Interstate
Commerce Act of 1887.</p>

<p>A phenomenon of national importance was the rapid expansion
of export trade in staple commodities, through New
Orleans, Galveston and other Gulf ports. This began in 1889
when the Illinois Central first engaged in export business in
grain. It soon assumed considerable proportions, with the
growth of population and agriculture in the southwestern part
of the United States; and, with the completion of the Panama
Canal in 1913, will doubtless be even more notable in future.
The opening of new railway connections with these Gulf ports
about 1896 led to still further expansion of this trade. An
immediate result was of course a decline in the relative importance
of the great Atlantic seaports, particularly New York.
A growing appreciation of this fact is accountable for the great
interest in New York state in projects for enlarging the Erie
Canal. A few figures, together with the diagram on the next
page, illustrate the situation. A generation ago about nine-tenths
of our exports of wheat and about seven-tenths of our
exports of flour, went out through the port of New York. In
1899 less than one-half of our wheat and less than one-third of
our flour was exported through the same city. The larger part
of this loss ensued after 1896, with the opening of new lines to
the Gulf ports as above mentioned. The New York Commerce
Commission in its report for 1900 found that for 1899, while
the nation's total foreign shipments of wheat was larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
at any time since 1892, New York actually exported twenty
million bushels less than seven years earlier. Exports in 1900
were the smallest in her history, forming, that is to say, the
lowest proportion of the total exports of the United States.
They were actually about a million bushels of wheat less than
went out through the two principal Gulf ports. An indirect
result of this growth of New Orleans and Galveston was an intense
competition between all the Atlantic trunk lines interested
in the eastern seaports and the railroads tributary to the Gulf
of Mexico. The part of the country most affected by this
competition, of course, was that portion about equidistant
from the two sea coasts. This rivalry led to rate wars on a
scale not witnessed before since the trunk line struggles during
the seventies. St. Louis, Kansas City and all the region
thereabouts, enjoyed the benefit of ruinously low rates as a
consequence,&mdash;an advantage not accorded to other parts of
the country. One cannot doubt that this factor was most
influential in encouraging the growth of their population and
trade.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>EXPORT OF WHEAT
BY SEAPORTS
MILLION BUSHELS</p></div>
</div>

<p>The development of the Gulf ports more recently, together
with the situation respecting rate wars on export grain, is still
further indicated by the chart. When New Orleans in 1891
considerably increased its business through the activities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the Illinois Central Railroad, it speedily developed that climatic
conditions led to saturation of the grain with moisture in the
vessels' holds. This fact, together with other difficulties, discouraged
progress. But, for a time, with the revival of foreign
commerce in 1897, both the Gulf and Atlantic ports shared in the
greatly increased business. Galveston had now come into the
field; and at times surpassed New Orleans in importance by
virtue of the development of wheat fields in the Southwest.
But the overweening ambition of these Gulf ports, threatening
as they did the supremacy of New York, led to intense rivalry.
All the lines to the Gulf became finally pitted against all the
trunk lines serving the Atlantic seaboard. The advantage for
two or three years seemed to lie with the southern lines; and,
as the chart indicates, in 1903-1904 grain exports through New
Orleans and Galveston actually exceeded those of any other
ports. After the utter collapse of export business in 1905,
trouble once more threatened to break out; but it was fortunately
averted by a compromise effected in 1906. The Gulf
lines on through freight demanded a substantial differential
to offset certain disabilities, such as the longer haul, poorer
service and climatic damage to which they were exposed. The
trunk lines successfully met this contention in part, and finally
brought about a peaceful settlement of the difficulty. Under
this arrangement of a small differential in favor of the Gulf,
New York, as the chart shows, has once more resumed its
pre&euml;minence as compared with the rest of the country. But
of late the ever-lessening volume of surplus American grain
for export to Europe<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has rendered the question of far less
importance than at one time it threatened to assume.</p>

<p>The rapid growth and development of the Canadian railroads
and ports has also been notable in recent years. The
Grand Trunk Railway was a factor in Chicago business from
the very first; and had to be reckoned with in all trunk line
rate adjustments. The dressed beef rate war of 1887 proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
this fact. But a new era of Canadian competition was inaugurated
with the opening by the Canadian Pacific of the so-called
"Soo" route in 1890, across the straits of Mackinac, thus
opening a short line from St. Paul and Minneapolis to the East.
Persistent rate wars during the next few years, particularly
1892-1893, finally led to recognition of the claims of this lien
by the trunk lines. Much business was undoubtedly diverted
from Chicago. Between 1884 and 1891 the flour shipped from
Minneapolis increased over fifty per cent., yet the proportion
going by way of Chicago largely declined. Much of this
business, of course, ultimately reaches the seaboard by the
combined Lake and rail routes; but a large part goes out
through Canada during the open season. Yet, on the other
hand, it is equally true that the wonderful development of the
Canadian Northwest since 1905, contributes in many ways to
the prosperity of American carriers and seaports.</p>

<p>As for new railroad construction since 1890, as shown by
the statistical chart on page <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, it has been proportionately
much slower than during the eighties. From about five thousand
miles laid down in 1890, a drop ensued to less than two
thousand miles in each of the four years of depression after
1893. And the former rate was not resumed until 1901, since
which time construction has ranged about six thousand miles
annually. This slackened rate of growth during the last
fifteen years is an indication of a fact of great importance.
The country as a whole with almost 250,000 miles of line in 1911
seems to be fairly well supplied with transportation routes.
It seems as if the main trunk lines and systems had now been
provided, leaving for the future the problem of constructing
branches and feeders and of increasing facilities upon the main
lines already built by duplication of tracks and enlargement of
terminals. A comparison of the rates of growth of mileage
and traffic, or of density of traffic, shows how new construction
is lagging behind the development of business. Present conditions
may best be shown by a few figures. The total mileage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of the United States is nearly equal to a ten track railroad
completely encircling the globe. The United States had
already in 1900 about forty per cent. of the aggregate mileage
of the world, considerably exceeding the total mileage of all
the countries of Europe combined. The situation may be
illustrated in another way, by reference to the relation of mileage
to population and area. Europe in 1902 had about 7.4
kilometres of line to every 10,000 inhabitants, as compared
with 41.4 kilometres (twenty-six miles) for the United States.
This shows that proportionately to population the United
States is about six times as well equipped with railroads as
Europe. Similar results appear with reference to superficial
area. As compared with Europe alone, we have about two-thirds
as much mileage to every square mile of territory, despite
the fact that our density of population is only about one-seventh
of that of Austria Hungary&mdash;one of the most sparsely
populated countries in Europe. These figures show conclusively
that our railroad problems for the future will be mainly
concerned with accommodating the huge volume of existing
traffic along the routes already built, rather than in seeking to
develop new ones to parallel the old.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several essential peculiarities of American railroad development
stand out in sharp relief by comparison with the experience
of Europe. The most significant, perhaps, is the large
amount of public participation in construction, evinced through
liberal grants of aid in lands, credit and cash by both the state
and Federal governments. The huge aggregate of these state
subventions is not generally appreciated. Because our railroads
are now private concerns, so far at least as legal title is
concerned, it is too often assumed in public discussion that
they owe their existence solely to private initiative and enterprise.
With all credit to their sturdy builders, to whose vision
and courage so much is due, the plain historical fact remains
that the people of the United States have had a large share in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the great task of creating our present railway net,&mdash;not indirectly
alone, through settlement of the virgin territory, but
immediately and directly through land grants and subventions.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The total of land grants by state and Federal governments
in aid of railroads, according to the most careful estimates, is
approximately, 155,000,000 acres,&mdash;that is to say, about
242,000 square miles. The United States alone is believed to
have given about 26,000,000 acres or 40,000 square miles. For
purposes of comparison, the following table of present-day areas
is useful.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="table of present-day areas">

<p>It thus appears that a gift of territory greater by about one-fifth
than the entire area either of the German Empire or
France, almost equal in size to the state of Texas or four times
the New England states, has, at one time or another, been
made in aid of railroad construction. The Federal grants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
equal about two-thirds of the area of the New England states,
or, in other words, are about five times the size of the state of
Massachusetts. A large proportion of the area of the newer
commonwealths was offered as a bonus to railroads. Seven
western states&mdash;including, for example, Minnesota, Iowa, and
Wisconsin&mdash;gave away from a fifth to a quarter of their birthrights.
Nebraska donated one-seventh, and California one-eighth.
The Lone Star state discovered in 1882 that in her
youthful ardor she had given away some 8,000,000 acres more
than she possessed.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Shall it ever be said, in the face of such
evidence, that these common carriers are private concerns, to
be administered solely in the interest of holders of their
securities?</p>

<p>As concerns aid in the form of funds or credit, that is to
say, through subscription to railroad stocks or bonds, it is
hazardous to venture statistics, particularly for the separate
states and municipalities. But the statement<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of direct appropriations
and subscriptions to securities on the next page is
as reliable as any. The amount of municipal and local aid can
only be a matter of guess work, even nominally, to say nothing
of its real cash value. Including everything from the heavy
investments of such cities as Baltimore ($3,500,000) or Cincinnati
($10,000,000) down to those of little places like Watertown,
Wisconsin,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> with its railroad debt of $750,000 on a
population of 7,553 souls ($100 <i>per capita</i>), the total for local
aid as above stated seems conservative enough. For Massachusetts
alone no fewer than 171 town and city bond issues for
railroad construction were authorized in the forty years to
1871. The municipalities in Wisconsin by 1874, despite its
later settlement, issued about seven million dollars in bonds
for similar purposes. As long as the state legislatures were
free to appropriate moneys, they did so with a lavish hand;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>but when, as in Illinois in 1848, they were constitutionally
prohibited from doing so, the enthusiasm shifted to the lesser
governmental units. Forty-three counties in Nebraska, between
1869 and 1892, voted subsidy bonds to railroads to the
amount of $4,918,000. In the case of towns and cities, also,
it was possible to play off one against another. No ambitious
community could stand idly by and see a new railroad go to
a rival place. There was no option but to vote bonds. And
farmers, as in Illinois, who had no cash, simply mortgaged
their farms. It is clear that in the aggregate these local
contributions greatly exceeded in amount those of the state
and National governments.</p>

<p>A true estimate of the proportions of this public aid recognizes,
of course, that many of these grants possessed only a
nominal value. The eighty-mile line in Texas, cited by Potts
as the recipient of 588,000 acres of land, was glad enough to
dispose of them for sixteen cents an acre. Stickney mentions
a Minnesota half-breed member of the legislature who took
ten dollars in cash for his vote on a railroad bond subsidy,
rather than $100,000 in capital stock. But, on the other
hand, if the land or bonds had little value, the roads themselves
were actually laid down at a very low cost. It was the proportion
of public aid to total real investment which was significant.
Wisconsin to 1874 had officially subsidized its roads
to the amount of over $21,000,000, including lands at three
dollars per acre. This sum was sufficient to have met one-half
the legitimate cost of construction of the properties then
existent. Reliable evidence<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> tends to show that the state and
National governments, up to 1870, had pledged themselves one
way or another for a sum equivalent to one-fifth of the cost of
construction of the 47,000 miles of line then in the United
States. And approximately another fifth, at the very least,
must have been contributed from local and municipal sources.</p>

<p>In point of time, public aid by the states was quite unevenly
distributed.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Massachusetts and Maryland, about 1826, were
the first to take notice. But in the northern states most of
the activity was confined to the period of 1837-1840; whereas,
in the South, governmental subsidies did not become frequent
until 1850. The whole movement, so far as the separate
states were concerned, came to an end about 1870; after which
time, with the exception of Massachusetts and Texas, little
more financial encouragement of the sort is recorded. In
many instances the hands of legislators were tied by constitutional
prohibitions; and in other cases the railway net had
been so far completed as to lessen the zeal of the public in the
work. The centre of interest after the Civil War, in fact, is to
be found in the activities of the Federal government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>More than a broad-line sketch of the land grants and
subsidies to railroads by the United States would be out
of proportion.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Sporadic grants in the South were made
directly as early as 1835; but the first considerable transfer
was made by act of Congress in 1850. This statute ceded to
the state of Illinois the alternate, even-numbered sections of
land for six sections in width on each side of the projected
Illinois Central Railroad and its branches. The state then
promptly turned over these lands to the promoters of the
line. The Federal government lost nothing by the transaction.
Rather did it gain,&mdash;the lands having been long in
the market,&mdash;through the sale of the odd sections at a more
than doubled price. Similar extensions of this grant soon followed
down through Alabama and Mississippi. Then other
states demanded recognition. Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa,
Louisiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota were in turn appeased.
The last direct grant to a state was made to Michigan in
1872. With the rise of interest in the Far West, the Federal
government during the Civil War period inaugurated a new
policy of direct charter and subsidy. Under this plan most
of the transcontinental lines were built.</p>

<p>The Union Pacific Railroad was the most notable beneficiary
of the Federal government. Its experience may be offered
as typical. By an act of 1864, twenty alternate sections of
land per mile were granted, together with a subscription to
junior bonds to the amount of $27,600,000. With this substantial
encouragement the road was soon completed. The
following table gives details concerning the succeeding grants
to other companies.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The primary investment of the United States in this pioneer
road was thus considerable. Despite elaborate sinking-fund
provisions, the combination of speculation, fraud and mismanagement
in its affairs, rendered even the payment of
current interest charges impossible. Matters went from bad
to worse, especially after 1883 when several new competitive
routes were opened&mdash;the Southern and Northern Pacific
roads, the Atchison and the Burlington. Bankruptcy ensued
in 1893, a state of affairs which, as it soon appeared, could not
be bettered until provision should be made for settlement of
the government's claim.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Various proposals for partial payment
proved unsuccessful. Until at last, in 1897, under
threat of foreclosure proceedings, the banking interests in
charge of reorganization agreed to a settlement in full&mdash;$27,200,000
principal and $31,200,000 interest. The outcome
a year later on the Kansas Pacific, was less fortunate. The
United States received payment of the principal of its lien,
$6,300,000; but was obliged to forego the interest, amounting to
about as much more. Then, in turn, in 1899, the Central Pacific
claim, amounting to $27,855,000 principal and $30,957,000 interest
was disposed of by being refunded in notes payable
semi-annually over a period of ten years. Thus, with unexpected
ease and despatch, was the direct interest of the United
States in railroad affairs brought to a brilliant conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>A striking characteristic of American transportation history,
emphasized by the foregoing account of land grants
and subsidies, is its essentially speculative character. Railroads
were more often constructed in advance of population
and settlement than to accommodate traffic already in existence.
Speculation, as will appear in another volume, has
permeated all of our railroad finance. In the early days the
most extravagant visions of development were indulged in on
all sides. In the words of a Wisconsin legislative committee in
1854 protesting against the passage of further laws for the
encouragement of railroad construction: "In imagination
every acre of land from Walker's Point to Snake Hollow has
been plowed, sowed, fenced, and is bearing forty bushels of
wheat.&mdash;Such estimates are quite delusive.&mdash;It takes money
to make railroads. It takes money to make the mare go;
much more the iron horse." True indeed, then and now!
But a review of our transportation history makes it plain that
without this national note of optimism and adventure, the
vast capital creation in railroads of the present time could
never have been called into being. Public aid and private
enterprise and sagacity were alike needed to accomplish the
great work in hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dominating events in our later economic history, so
far as railroads are concerned, have been the period of severe
distress and prostration following the panic of 1893; a subsequent
revival of prosperity, with unprecedented demands for
transportation during the ten years thereafter until 1907;
and a movement toward consolidation of the railroad net into
great territorial systems, notably during the two years after
1898, as a result of which competition was practically eliminated
from all railroad business. The long decline in freight rates
was succeeded after 1900 by a steady rise of charges; the
phenomenal prosperity and consolidations led to wild speculative
outbreaks on the stock exchanges, especially in 1901<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and 1906; and the spread of industrial consolidation enormously
emphasized the evils and abuses of personal discrimination
and favoritism. As a result of these influences there
arose in turn, after 1900, an irresistible demand for greater
governmental supervision, both of rates and of finance. Taken
all in all, these later years have witnessed both a public and
private interest in railroads, greater perhaps than at any
earlier period of our history. But these later events, aside
from being set in their proper relation to the whole in this
preliminary general survey, require detailed analysis each one
by itself. Where not considered within these covers, they
will be treated in a second volume dealing primarily with
matters of finance and corporate organization.</p>

<p>Analysis of the theory of railroad rates begins naturally
with a study of railroad expenditures. The examination of
earnings is not feasible until a later time. For neither a railroad
nor a factory can earn money until it has first liberally
expended it. A physical plant must be provided, in the first
place, which means the guarantee of interest on a large capital;
and, secondly, it must often be operated unprofitably at the
outset. This is especially true in a new and undeveloped
country like the United States; where demand for transportation
must be frequently created by the invasion of virgin territory,
making it inviting for settlement. Twenty years ago
such an analysis of railroad expenditures with any approach
to precision, owing to the absence of scientific data, would have
been impossible. A few companies, such as the Pennsylvania,
the Union Pacific and the Louisville &amp; Nashville, had indeed
attempted to systematize their accounts; but there was no
agreement as to details, despite a certain harmony in questions
of principle. But since the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce
in 1887, and largely owing to the work of Prof. Henry
C. Adams as statistician to the Interstate Commerce Commission,
the matter may now be examined profitably in detail.
The data is published annually in a volume entitled "Statistics
of Railways in the United States." The amplified powers of
the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1906 have consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>erably
changed the system in force since the original law of
1887; but the general principles remain unchanged.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> One
feature of the new law, however, is important. Not only must
detailed reports be periodically and promptly made; but no
company is now permitted to keep its books in any other form
than the one officially prescribed. This standard was adopted
after extended conference with the Association of American
Railway Accounting Officers, which body has, in fact, officially
approved of the form adopted in most regards. These accounts,
therefore, may be said to represent the combined intelligence
of the practical and theoretical analysts, of the operating and
financial staffs, and of the governmental supervisory board.
A great impetus to scientific railroad economics has undoubtedly
resulted from this co&ouml;peration between government
officials and private managements.</p>

<p>The primary distinction in railroad expenses is between
those which are constant and independent of the volume of
traffic, and those which vary more or less directly in proportion
to it. Thus, of the total outlay, it may at once be premised
that for a time, at least, certain capital expenditures are
entirely unrelated to the volume of business transported. Interest
on bonded indebtedness is neither increased nor diminished,
up to a certain point, by the number of tons of freight
moved; whereas, on the other hand, other items of expenditure,
such as wages of train hands and fuel cost, are more or
less directly affected. The distinction above mentioned finds
its clearest expression in the primary division of railroad
accounts into so-called "operating expenses," which are variable;
and "fixed charges," which, as the name implies, are constant.
Much of the direct wear and tear of equipment belongs
to the first class, while, as we have said, interest on its own
funded or floating debt, together with capital obligations on
leased lines, naturally fall into the second group. This second
class of constant expenses, which along with taxes is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
denominated in railway reports "Deductions from Income,"
is a relatively large one. Thus, in 1910, out of a total expenditure
by all the operating railroads of the United States of
$1,822,000,000, no less than $490,000,000, or about 27 per cent.,
consisted of interest on debt and taxes. This proportion of
absolutely fixed expenditures, moreover, shows a remarkable
constancy throughout a series of years. It reached high-water
mark during the hard times in 1895, at 33.07 per cent.
of all outlay. Indebtedness had accumulated unduly, while
at the same time the volume of traffic was so small that mere
operating expenses dwindled in proportion. But since that
time, largely as a result of the financial reorganizations of
1893-1897, the percentage of fixed charges has reached its
present low point. This improvement is also in part due to the
growth of traffic, and thereby of operating expenses. The latter
have indeed grown faster than the accumulation of debt, owing
to the practice prevalent among American roads of paying for
many improvements and additions out of surplus income,
rather than by charging them to capital account,&mdash;that is to
say, by borrowing money to pay for them.</p>

<p>Having at the outset deducted approximately one-quarter
of our total expenditures to meet fixed charges, we may now
proceed to analyze those outlays which remain. And this is
to be done, always keeping in mind the fundamental distinction
between constant and variable items. From 1887 until
1906 the operating expenses of American railroads were allocated
in the four following groups:</p>


<ul class="index"><li>(1) Maintenance of Way and Structures</li>
<li>(2) Maintenance of Equipment</li>
<li>(3) Conducting Transportation</li>
<li>(4) General Expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>This grouping under the new law of 1906 has been somewhat
redistributed. But inasmuch as most of the statistical
data as yet available is presented under the above-named heads,
we shall adhere to that classification. This we may the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
properly do, as our object is to show the general bearing of
railroad expenditures upon rate making, rather than specifically
to analyze cost accounts. For this simple purpose the above
arrangement is entirely adequate.</p>

<p>The general nature of each of these above named groups is
roughly expressed by its title. Under the first, Maintenance
of Way, are segregated those outlays which have to do with
the up-keep of the roadway and permanent structures in proper
shape for the moving of trains. It includes, besides such
obvious items as ballast, rails, ties and the wages of track
men, every outlay on permanent structures, such as bridges
and tunnels, stations, grain elevators, stock pens, gas, oil and
water tanks, and even scrap bins and eating houses. To
these are added scores of other minor items, such as maintenance
of telegraph lines, fences and cattle guards, signal plants and
docks and wharves. Every kind of tool or appliance used,
and all wages paid in connection with the maintenance of this
part of the property are included. Insurance and even the
legal costs and damages incurred in connection with accidents,
are all assigned to the appropriate property. The second group,
Maintenance of Equipment expenses, includes, as the name
implies, the proper care and preservation of all the rolling stock
in good working order. Repairs and renewals of all locomotives,
cars and vessels, form the largest single items. But all
shop machinery and power plants are included, with specification
in detail of every appliance needed in connection with
the work, as, for example, over one hundred and fifty possible
items from "adze handles, ammonia and auger bits" down to
"wire brushes, wrenches and zincs." Conducting Transportation
expenses, the third group, are supposed to provide for the
actual movement of traffic. The two former classes of expenditure
having put the fixed plant and rolling stock in condition,
it remains to operate the property. Under this head is
chargeable all costs of coal and supplies, wages of train hands
from enginemen to car porters, yard, station, switch and sig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>nalmen
and telegraph operators. To these are added such
items as "purchased power," "cleaning cars," "clearing
wrecks," and "losses and damages"; in short, every conceivable
item of expenditure which can be assigned to the service as
distinct from the mere property.</p>

<p>A fourth group of expenditures remains, denominated General
Expenses. This includes all salaries of principal administrative
officers from the president or receiver down to the
real estate and tax agents, together with all their allowances
for expenses, special cars or trains and the like. All clerical
salaries in the general offices naturally belong here, as well
as most of the legal expenses, outlay for pensions, relief departments
and the like.</p>

<p>A distinct improvement in the matter of principle has been
made in the revised classification of operating expenses under
the new law of 1906, by the segregation of a fifth group, denominated
Traffic Expenses.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These cover all the work of soliciting
business, making rates and accounting for freight and
passenger traffic. Such outlays were formerly grouped in the
main under conducting transportation, but, as is quite evident,
they are distinct in their nature from the expenses incidental
to the actual handling of trains. Administrative railroad
organization has long recognized the peculiar and important
nature of this work by constituting it a separate department,
usually headed by one of the vice-presidents of the road. The
main items under this special head are salaries and expenses
of a large staff of officers and clerks, such as general passenger
and freight managers, agents and travelling solicitors; rents
and care of offices at home or abroad; advertising, membership
in traffic associations, immigration and industrial bureaus,
expenses for experimental farms, field demonstrators, donations
to expositions, fairs and stock shows&mdash;everything, in brief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>which tends to create or keep business, to be afterward actually
handled by the transportation departments. In future the
detailed official statistics will segregate these expenses; but at
the present writing and in statistics down to 1906 they must
be bulked in with conducting transportation. An important
modification in accounting under the new law of 1906 has also
been made in respect to depreciation charges. Heretofore
the practice of companies varied widely, as will hereafter be
shown. Under the new rulings a definite and uniform system
of charging off for depreciation has to be provided, the details
of which, however, need not concern us at this time.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

expenditures grouped under the proper headings:</p>

<div class="caption"><p>PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF OPERATING EXPENSES, 1890&mdash;1906</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the first two
columns the percentages
given relate
to the operating
expenditures alone,
without reference
to the total expenses&mdash;eliminating,
that is to say,
the large group of
fixed charges, and
treating these operating
costs entirely
by themselves as if
the others were non-existent.
In the
third or right-hand
column, it will be
observed, the main
groups are again
given in percentages,
not of the operating expenses alone, but of the total
outgo, including capital expenditures in the nature of fixed
charges. It should also be noted, of course, that only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the large or more important items are here included, and
in the right-hand column no details, other than for the four
main headings, have been computed. The constancy in the
distribution of these groups of railroad expenditures over a
term of years is graphically shown by the opposite diagrams.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The perpendicular line for each year is divided proportionately
to the relative importance of each designated item of expense
for that year. Thus the course of the horizontal lines, dividing
the four main percentage zones, represents the ups and downs
in the relative importance of each item. Occasionally, as in
the years following 1895, the proportion of so-called general
expenses decreased appreciably; but, in the main, all the items
moved more or less in unison subject to the movements of wages
and prices. This relative constancy proves how fundamental
the arrangement of groups is.</p>

<p>The attempt to differentiate the constant from the variable
expenses of railroads on the basis of the foregoing operating
statistics may now be made. What proportion of each item
in the table for each of the large groups is fixed in amount;
and what proportion fluctuates more or less in connection with
the volume of traffic?</p>

<p>Under the first category, Maintenance of Way and Structures,
absorbing about one-fifth of operating expenses, over
one-half is incurred for so-called "repairs of roadway." It is
evident that a large part of this expense is due not to wear
but to weather. A costly plant is exposed to every vicissitude
of flood, fire, and waste. Re-ballasting and realignment may be
somewhat more expensive where traffic is heavy; but certainly
all general repairs, the wages of track walkers, the removal
of snow, ice, and weeds, must be attended to entirely irrespective
of the number or size of passing trains. Of the second
item, renewals of rails, it is probable that this expenditure is
directly traceable to wear and tear in large part. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
trains, the heavier the locomotive and cars or the higher the
speed, the more rapidly must these rails be replaced. But
even so, the proportionate amount is small, constituting generally
between five and ten per cent. only of the group expenditure
for maintenance of way. With ties, an item about twice
as important as rails, the case is exactly the reverse. Ties rot
out rather than wear out. They have a natural life varying
from four to fourteen years, as influenced by climate, ballast,
and drainage. The necessary expenditure per mile for them
by different roads varies greatly, as might be expected; but
it seems to bear little relation to the density of traffic. As for
the principal remaining items under Maintenance of Way,
such as repairs of bridges and buildings; if properly designed to
withstand their loads and strains, most expenses of their up-keep
such as repainting and reroofing should be practically
independent of the volume of business. A recent elaborate
discussion of these matters in 1907 in the Wisconsin Two-Cent
Fare decision, reached the conclusion that all of the cost of
rails, one-third of the ties and ten per cent. of expenditures
for roadway, track and bridges, are all that can properly be
charged to wear from traffic, as opposed to natural depreciation.
Acworth illustrates this point by comparison of the Midland
&amp; Great Western Railway of Ireland and the Lancashire &amp;
Yorkshire Railroad. These two are of about equal length,
approximately 530 miles. The latter carries forty times the
traffic of the former road, and yet its expenses for maintenance
of way are only eight times as much. It seems safe, in general,
to conclude that in this first large group of expenditures for
maintenance of the fixed plant, probably not over one-third
are variable to any considerable degree. Acworth for England
estimates this proportion at about two-fifths.</p>

<p>The proportion of variable expenditures for Maintenance of
Equipment&mdash;the second group&mdash;is probably higher than in
that of maintenance of way. This is due to two causes. Rolling
stock is, of course, subjected more directly to wear and tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in service than are bridges, cuts and fills and buildings. Rolling
stock, moreover, is susceptible to change of type and improvement.
Its effective life is thus shortened both by use
and by replacement. Before being worn out it may have become
antiquated. More powerful locomotives and larger cars
suited to new requirements of the business may necessitate
scrapping otherwise good equipment. This very fact, however,
imposes upon the management the need of intensive
service while it lasts. All the mileage possible must be extracted
from each vehicle before it goes out of date, and this
implies a higher proportion of wear-out than of mere rust-out.
Yet the fact is still true that many of the items in this class
are unaffected by the mileage or tonnage performance. There
is little difference in wear on a freight car as between light
and moderately heavy loads; and as for passenger cars, the
actual wear assignable to the paying load is a negligible quantity.
We may, at all events, risk an estimate in the statement
that probably not over half of all the expenditures of a railroad
for maintenance of equipment vary with the volume of
the business.</p>

<p>The direct effect of a changing volume of business is most
clearly seen in the third group of operating expenses, having
to do with Conducting Transportation. This is very important,
comprising as shown by the table on page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>, no less than
fifty-five per cent. of operating outlay and forty per cent. of
total expenditures including fixed charges. At first glance it
would appear as if, at last, one had here to do with a direct
relativity between cost and volume of business. Surely the
cost of fuel for motive power will vary with the tonnage moved!
This item, amounting in 1905 to no less than $156,000,000 for
the railroads of the United States, was the largest in the budget,
constituting eleven per cent. of all operating expenses. Yet
brief consideration shows that even here much of this expense
is constant and invariable. A locomotive will burn fully one-third
as much coal merely to move its own weight as to haul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a loaded train. Five to ten per cent. of its total daily consumption
is required merely for firing up to the steaming point.
Twenty-five to fifty pounds of coal per hour go to waste in
holding steam pressure while a freight train is waiting on a
siding. Every stop of a train going thirty miles per hour
dissipates energy enough to have carried it two miles along a
level road. In brief, expert evidence shows that of this important
expenditure for coal, from thirty to fifty per cent. is
entirely independent of the number of cars or the amount of
freight hauled. The largest wage items in this group of conducting
transportation expenses are for engine and roundhouse
men, and conductors and brakemen. This expense is,
of course, even more independent of the volume of business
than the cost of coal. No more engine men or conductors are
needed for a heavy through express or freight train than for
a single car tram on a branch line. And the extra cost for
service of more brakemen as the size of the train increases,
is relatively unimportant when modern equipment with air
brakes is used. Appreciation of this fact is largely responsible
for the great increase in train loads in recent years. Train-mile
costs can be economized most effectively by distributing
the wages of a train crew over as large a tonnage as possible
of paying freight. As for the wages of station men, switch
and flag men, they are largely, and often entirely, independent
of the amount of business. From all these considerations, it
appears that at a conservative estimate, no less than fifty per
cent. of the cost of conducting transportation constitutes a
fixed charge upon the property once it is in operation, irrespective
of the volume of business transacted.</p>

<p>The group of general expenses, which alone remains for
analysis, is relatively small in amount. It is obvious that these
outlays are a constant burden but slightly influenced by the
variation in traffic. Salaries may indeed be reduced somewhat
during hard times&mdash;a few clerks may be laid off; but, on the
other hand, this being an expense of organization, the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
staff must be maintained at about a certain standard of
efficiency regardless of business.</p>

<p>Summarizing our estimates thus far, we may reconstruct
a table, distributing expenditures theoretically according
as they are constant or variable in somewhat the following
way:</p>

<p>Thus one arrives at the general conclusion that approximately
two-thirds of the total expenditure of a railroad and more than
one-half of the actual operating expenses are independent of
the volume of traffic. The remaining third of all expenditures,
or what amounts to the same thing, the other half of the operating
expenses, are immediately responsive to any variation in
business. Applied to the railroad net of the United States,
this means that only about one-third of the $2,000,000,000
disbursed in 1905&mdash;an amount equal to about two and one-half
times the national debt&mdash;was susceptible of variation
according as the traffic expanded or decreased. This provisional
estimate, defective principally because of inadequacy of the
returns as to depreciation and replacement, agrees in the main
with computations based upon other data. The Vice-President
of the Southern Pacific Railroad, in 1892, after extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
investigation, arrived at precisely the same general conclusion.
The great German authority, Sax, estimates that one-half of
a road's operating outlay is constant and that this operating
outgo equals about half the total expenditure, the other half
being capital cost and hence constant. This calculation places
the constant factors even higher than ours, viz., at about three-fourths
of the total expenditure. Eaton states that half of the
operating expenses respond to changes in the volume of traffic.
Our estimate, above detailed, seems to be in accord therefore
with good authority, and differs but little from any of the
reliable writers.</p>

<p>It should be observed in passing that the relative distribution
of outgo above mentioned, varies greatly both as between
different railroads and, on the same road, as between different
years.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> During lean seasons the imperative need of reducing
expenses generally induces the heaviest inroads on expenditure
for maintenance of way. Nearly one-third of these expenditures
can probably be postponed for short periods without
serious detriment to operation; but, of course, there is for each
property an irreducible minimum at which economy must
halt. On the other hand, the cost of moving each train, that
is to say, the outlay for fuel and wages, cannot be greatly cut,
although some discontinuance of freight trains may take place.
The most readily postponable outlay is therefore found in the
department of maintenance of way. Two hundred ties per
mile may be annually renewed instead of twice that number
for a year or two. Heavy decreases in the wage account for
road and track men may be effected, sometimes at the cost of
public safety perhaps, but none the less effectively from an
immediate fiscal point of view. A series of hard years thus
always results in heavy proportional curtailments of maintenance
of way expenses. In 1895, for instance, midway between
the two worst years of the depression of 1893-1897,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>only 19.82 per cent. of operating expenses was devoted to
maintenance of way, with 15.76 per cent. expended for maintenance
of equipment.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Six years later, in the full tide of
prosperity, the outlay for maintenance of way had risen to
22.27 per cent. With over 350,000 freight cars idle on sidings,
as during the spring of 1908, expenditures on repairs of equipment
may temporarily be postponed. Depreciation rather
than wear takes place. An economy of about five per cent.
may temporarily be effected in this wise. It is only with the
return of prosperity that the temporary postponement of this
expenditure makes itself felt. Economy at the expense of
efficiency is poor business policy in the long run. With the
revival of activity on the other hand, as in 1898, there may be
witnessed a sudden concentration of the postponed expenditures
of the preceding years. The Illinois Central was spending
$1,400 per mile on maintenance of way in 1905, as against
only $1,150 in 1897. A succession of fruitful years may, however,
find the property so thoroughly kept up that some measure
of relaxation in expenditures may ensue. During these good
years with heavy traffic, it is the maintenance of equipment
charges which tend to rise. Locomotives and cars are constantly
in need of repair owing to hard usage. This was a
noticeable feature during the four years after 1900. The
Illinois Central, expending only $866 per mile for maintenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>of equipment in 1897, laid out $2,200 per mile for the same
purpose in 1907.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as in January, 1903, or November, 1906, general
wage increases all along the line take place. These, of course,
affect all branches of the service. Supplies of all kinds may
also enhance in price. It was doubtless the rise in the price
of coal which increased the proportionate importance of the
fuel item in the railroad budget of the United States from 9.8
per cent. in 1900 to 11.8 per cent. in 1904. The tremendous
rise in expenses of all kinds in 1907 was not at first appreciated
because of the large volume of traffic. It was only when the
sharp decline in business following the panic in October of that
year took place, that the full influence of this factor became
apparent.</p>

<p>As between different roads also, the relative proportion of
the various elements of cost will vary according to circumstances.
Northern lines are exposed to heavy maintenance
of way charges, owing to snow, ice, and frost. In rugged districts
or with heavy grades, expensive operation is apparent in
high conducting transportation expenses. On the Pennsylvania
trunk line, rising to 2,100 ft. above sea level and with
many curves, the distribution of expenditures is quite different
from that on the New York Central, which operates a straighter
line at about water grade. On the Union Pacific, movement
expenses have been at times over fifty per cent. higher than
on the St. Paul road, which operates in level country. It is a
combination of high grades and poor equipment, which undoubtedly
keeps the relative cost of conducting transportation
so high on the Erie. The proportion of local to through business
is of importance in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Railroads like the
Boston &amp; Maine or the St. Paul system before 1908, because
they have so much local business, contrast strongly with others
like the Chicago Great Western, the Erie or the old Fitchburg
Railroad. On the latter roads the distribution of expenses is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>different, because their large volume of through traffic carried
in bulk is so much cheaper to handle. Obviously, the expense
incident to frequent stops and loss of time, as well as in loading
and unloading local business, will be much greater than in
long haul trainload traffic. The cost of large items like fuel
will vary greatly in different parts of the country from perhaps
$1.25 per ton for coal in Pennsylvania up to $7 or more on the
Pacific coast. Since the recent discoveries of petroleum in
Texas and California, economies have been effected upon the
Southern Pacific, which by comparison with Northern Pacific,
still using coal, may be of great importance. More than six-tenths
of the cost of locomotive service is for fuel, so that a
reduction of cost from $4 a ton to an oil equivalent at $1 per
ton may aggregate a large sum. It has been estimated that
such a saving on 1,600,000 tons of coal would pay five per cent.
on an additional capital of $100,000,000. Similarly the character
of the freight, whether it be like coal, iron ore or grain,
cheaply handled, or merchandise which must be carefully
housed and treated; its regularity, whether it flows evenly
the year round like the dressed beef business, or as on the cotton
and cattle range roads, is concentrated in a short season and
all moves in one direction;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the relative proportions of freight
and passenger business&mdash;in New England about on an equality,
while in the West and South nearly nine-tenths freight; and,
finally, the efficiency of management, in the use of rolling stock,
making up trainloads and keeping all equipment busy; all of
these factors will influence the proportionate distribution of
expenditures. The operation of each road thus constitutes
an interesting problem in statistical analysis by itself.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

ROADS&mdash;1910</i></p></div>
<img src="images/illus078.jpg" width="700" height="504" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The relation of course between density of traffic and the
distribution of expenditures is direct. Heavy and frequent
trains increase the wear and tear as distinct from mere depreciation
from age and weather. This is demonstrated graphically
by the following diagram.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The solid black horizontal
belts to right of the centre show how low is the density of
traffic on the five upper western roads by contrast with the
five carriers in trunk line territory. The left hand horizontal
belts show proportionally in dollars the outlay per mile of
road for maintenance. Naturally the expense of such maintenance
is likewise less on the western lines. But when stated,
not absolutely in dollars per mile of road but in terms of utilization,
as by the shaded belts to right of the centre, the true state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>of things appears. Density considered, in other words, the
western roads are all as well kept up as those in the East. The
necessity at all times of interpreting such expenditures, not in
absolute figures but in terms of utilization, is obvious; and yet
it is not always done in practice.</p>

<p>Up to this point it has appeared as if, in making distinction
between the constant and variable expenditures of a railroad,
it was the latter only which grew as the volume of traffic increased.
This is not absolutely, but only relatively true,
not only of the so-called constant operating expenses, but of
fixed charges as well.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Everything depends upon the length
of time under consideration. Many expenses follow the fluctuations
of business, not evenly but by jerks. Up to the full
limit of utilization of the existing plant, each increment of
traffic seems to necessitate but a very small increase in the
so-called variable expenses, with hardly any change at all in
the constant ones. A branch road can haul more and more
tons of freight with a given outfit of cars and locomotives by
merely increasing slightly its outlay for fuel, train service,
wages and supplies. But after a certain point more rolling
stock must be provided to accommodate the growing business.
As each of these additions to property occur, they contribute
new quotas to the fixed charges and to the so-called constant
expenses of operation, such as maintenance of roadway and
the like. Nor can these new expenses be allocated to the new
business alone. The moment the old traffic has outgrown the
existing plant, the new expenditure becomes chargeable to all
the business alike. The new outgo must be distributed evenly
over the entire volume of traffic thereafter handled. Each
ton, both of old and of new traffic, beyond the haulage capacity
of the locomotives then in service, is equally responsible for
the expense of new equipment purchased. Although the old
business could have been handled without a million dollars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>spent for double-tracking or terminal enlargement, this addition
to the expense of maintenance of way or to the fixed charges
is equally attributable to every ton of traffic hauled.</p>

<p>A concrete example may aid in making this important
principle clear. The new through-freight trunk line built by
the Pennsylvania Railroad since 1900, paralleling its old four-track
one, represents both in the cost of maintenance and
capital charges, a sudden jump in the expense of transporting
each ton of freight on <i>both</i> lines, until such time as the new
business grows to a point where it can support the new line by
itself alone. The relation between increasing returns and
density of traffic is well illustrated in this instance. With
six tracks in operation nearly all the way from Pittsburg to
Philadelphia, the four old tracks are sometimes almost fully
utilized for passengers and fast freight. The extraordinary
density of traffic appears in the statement that this road in
1911 on 3534 miles of track handled one-third more ton miles
than the Union Pacific&mdash;by far the most worked of all the
western lines&mdash;handled on 13,674 miles of track. The two
new low-grade Pennsylvania freight tracks are used only for
slow traffic; largely coal and westbound steel empties. Not-withstanding
the extraordinary density of traffic on this extra
two track line, it probably does not meet the fixed charges
on cost of construction of the line. Yet the new double track
was absolutely necessary, regardless of its profitableness, in
order to relieve congestion on the old four tracks. In other
words, the demands of the service forced an expenditure which
in and of itself was not financially self-supporting. But the
profit from the old lines would be sufficiently enhanced to take
care of the whole. The bearing of such cases upon the capital
needs of the future is obvious. A resolutely conservative policy
of finance becomes imperative under such circumstances.</p>

<p>In much the same way, the general condition of congestion
reached in 1903-'05 on the eastern trunk lines and in the
West and South in 1906-'07, manifested mainly in the need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
for more tracks and terminals, represented the permanent
outgrowth of the old plant; and necessitated a readjustment
of capital expenses for the purpose of enlargement. Viewed
in a large way over a term of years, nearly every expenditure,
even the fixed charges which appear constant or independent
of the volume of business, thus become in reality imbued with
more or less variability.</p>

<p>The preceding considerations hold good not alone of increased
facilities, but of their curtailment as well. This point
is often neglected in respect of capital outlay, which once made
cannot be recalled. Rotting of ties we have held to be a constant
expense of operation. It goes on steadily, whether
traffic conditions be good or bad. But, on the other hand, those
ties, if they be under a third or fourth track, would never have
been laid had not there been a promise of business sufficient
to render the added investment profitable. As Lorenz observes,
"the question is not, What expenditures would disappear
if a certain proportion of the traffic should be discontinued?
but What expenditure would not now be incurred if
that traffic had never been called forth?" Viewed in this way,
even the necessary replacement of ties under a (temporarily)
little used extra track, is an expense determined at some time,
even if not always, by the volume of the business. In the long
run, therefore, the percentage of total cost which we may assign
to an increase in the volume of traffic, is higher than appears
from a cross-section of expenses, taken, as was at first had, in a
given year. Lorenz has illustrated this steady expansion of all
groups of expenditure in relation to expansion of traffic by the
following table, in which the actual figures for each year
[brought down to date] are replaced by an index number
based upon 100 for the year 1895. It would have been highly
suggestive to continue all of this data alike to the present time;
but, as noted on the table, certain items have been so modified
by changes in accounting practice, that this could not be
done.</p>

<p>According to this showing, maintenance of equipment, which
we held in our analysis to be about one-half a constant expense
and independent of traffic, especially after 1900, appears to
have actually outrun the expansion of ton-mileage and passenger
business. How largely this is due to actual purchases
for the sake of future growth is not determinable. And maintenance
of way outlay&mdash;one of our largely constant expenses&mdash;has
increased, in fact, more rapidly than conducting transportation,
which we held to be mainly variable. But these
figures are confused by the failure to differentiate in the accounts,
mere maintenance from actual improvements and
additions to plant. Expenditures for these latter purposes,
charged to operating expenses rather than to capital account,
have been so enormous during these years of prosperity that
they confuse the true facts utterly. It is to be hoped that now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
with the revised statistics since 1906, which will permit a
clearer definition of these expenditures in detail, an analysis
covering a series of years will bring out the real relationships.
Equally important is the fact that these years have been characterized
by rapid and extensive rises, both of prices and wages.
Had our table covered a longer series of years the results would
have been more clear. Until such an analysis be made, it will
suffice for our purpose, viz., the analysis of the principles of
railroad rate making, that we adhere to our first general conclusion,
namely&mdash;that of the total expenditures of a railroad
<i>at any given time</i> about two-thirds of them are constant, while
only one-third vary with the ups and downs of the volume of
traffic. Comprehending in survey a long period of years, it
might happen, as Acworth concludes, that nearly one-half of
the total expenditures were entirely fixed in character, leaving
the other half as dependent upon the amount of transportation
effected.</p>

<p>The manner in which heavy capital outlay for maintenance
accompanies as well as partly accounts for a decline in the cost
of conducting transportation on American roads, is graphically
shown by the diagram on the next page.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> During ten years
a steady decline in direct operating costs has accompanied an
equally marked upward tendency in expense of maintenance.
The bearing of this on the problem of rate advances in future
is direct. Profitableness results from two separate sources;
economical operation such as longer trains and better loading,
and also from far heavier capital investment in plant, by which
such operation is rendered possible.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Both alike, however,
attend upon increased volume of business. Heavy capital investment
may lessen immediate maintenance charges,&mdash;lower
grades and straighter alignment naturally wearing less; but,
on the other hand, the burden of interest and other fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>expenses steadily grows. How will they stand toward one
another by 1925 on the eastern trunk lines? Will growth of
business bring lower rates or not? A fine field for further
analysis is as yet unworked.</p>

TRANSPORTATION TO TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSE.</i></p></div>

</div>

<p>One final relation between operating and fixed expenses is left
for consideration. It is so well put by J. Shirley Eaton in an
unpublished paper, that it can best be stated in his own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is impossible to have an absolute and universal line of demarcation
between the direct and the fixed expense, that shall be the same
on all roads. One road chooses to reduce a grade and thereby increase
the capital account in order to save in the current expense of a helper
at a hill or the lost margin of efficiency of the loaded train on the level.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
The relation between a current expense and the annual charge of
the capitalized cost on a fixed plant that performed the same
service, was well illustrated in a case arbitrated by Mr. Blanchard
in New Orleans. One road which did not have access to the heart
of the city undertook to compensate its disadvantage by trucking to
and from its depot. The hire of a public truckman to perform the
service for its patrons was very soon commuted to the practice of paying
the amount of the truck expense to the consignee by deducting
it from the freight bill rendered, the consignee or shipper performing
the service. This, known as 'drayage equalization,' was claimed by
competitors to be in the nature of a rebate to secure business. The
arbitrator decided that the first roads had elected to buy their right
of way into the heart of the city; and the road that had not built into
the city elected to pay the expense of the same service in the shape of
a current drayage bill instead of in the shape of interest on money
invested in right of way. Therefore he decided there was no cause for
complaint."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></div>

<p>Railroad expenditures, as Taussig clearly pointed out a
number of years ago,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> afford a prime illustration of the production
of several commodities by a single great plant simultaneously
at joint and indistinguishable cost. The classic
economists illustrated this law by the joint production of wool
and mutton and of gas and coke. In both of these instances
neither commodity could conceivably be produced alone. Nor
was either one, so to speak, a by-product of the other. So
nearly of equal importance are the two, in fact, that the cost
of production for each may approximately be determined by
dividing the total cost according to the relative worths of the
two or more products. The law of joint cost with reference
to the production of transportation is somewhat different.
Compare, for instance, the carriage by a railroad of thousands
of passengers and different commodities in every direction,
under varying conditions, singly or by wholesale, slowly or
by express, over a given set of rails every day; with the operation
of a great refinery producing simultaneously kerosene,
gasoline, lubricating oils and greases as well as various odd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>chemicals. Both are examples of production at joint cost,
but with various important contrasts. In the refinery all the
costs are joint. All the processes are interlocked. Every
increase in the output of kerosene produces <i>pari passu</i> an
increase of the other commodities. On the railroad not all,
but only a part of the costs are joint, in such manner as has
been shown. For, from the joint portion of its plant&mdash;roadway
rails and locomotives&mdash;the railroad may produce transportation
of different sorts quite independently. It may choose to especially
cultivate its passenger traffic, or its cotton or coal business.
After a certain point of congestion is reached, the various
sorts of traffic on the railroad may even become actually competitive
with one another so far as the joint use of the plant
is concerned. It is plain that this could never happen in the
refinery. The use of more stills for making kerosene would
automatically produce more by-products of every sort. But
on a railroad it might well happen that the coal and passenger
business might come to interfere with one another. A choice
of emphasis as between fast refrigerator beef or fruit traffic,
and limited express service, may have to be made on a long
single track line. Nevertheless, in spite of these peculiarities
of transportation, the general law of joint costs holds good,
in that it is a demand for each service rather than its cost which
finally determines the chargeable rate.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> This must be so,
because of the fact that the cost of each shipment is so largely
joint and indeterminate, and that a large part of the entire
plant is indistinguishably devoted to the general production
of transportation without reference to particular units of business.
One concrete example may serve to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>For years attempts have been unsuccessfully made by accountants
to effect the primary separation between expenses
of passenger and freight business,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in order to determine the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>cost of transportation per unit in each case. Some companies
like the Louisville &amp; Nashville and the Burlington system,
still divide up the two, usually on the basis of the engine mileage
for each class of traffic. This may be serviceable enough for
comparisons of costs from year to year in the same company,
but it has no general value and it may, moreover, become highly
misleading. The most absurd conclusions may result. Thus
at one time it appeared from such data, compiled by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, that the New York Central,
with five times the density of traffic of the Illinois Central,
was actually conducting its freight business at a much higher
cost per ton mile. Such inconsistencies induced the Interstate
Commerce Commission in 1894 to abandon the attempt at any
such primary separation of accounts.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It has since been reattempted,
in special cases, as by the Wisconsin Railroad Commission
in its notable "Two-cent Fare" decision in 1907, the
division being made according to a number of different criteria.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>But it is plain that a very large proportion&mdash;probably
over half&mdash;of the expenditures for freight and passenger business
are entirely joint, however distinct the revenues from each
service may be. We have seen that approximately two-thirds
of the outgo is incurred on behalf of the property as a whole.
Certain expenses, to be sure, such as train wages, coal consumption
and the maintenance of rolling stock, are readily
divisible; but with respect to the maintenance of way and
structures&mdash;about forty per cent. of the total outgo&mdash;all guides
fail. Even in respect of the cost of rails, due to wear and
tear of train movement, we are quite at sea in the allocation
of expenses. Freight trains may indeed be four times as
heavy as passenger trains; but, on the other hand, they move
at far slower speeds. And then, finally, how about the large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>item of capital cost, the proportion of outgo for fixed charges?
This equals about twenty-seven per cent. of the total expenditures
for the United States as a whole. We may, of course,
divide these expenses arbitrarily on the basis of the relative
gross revenue from freight and passenger business respectively.
And yet how absurd it would be to attempt to allocate an expense
of a million dollars for the abolition of grade crossings in
this way. As between the New Haven road, with passenger
and freight revenues about equal, and a western road with only
one-tenth of its income derived from passengers, the apparent
cost of freight business on the eastern road would be absurdly
reduced by any such process. The facts are plain. So many
expenditures are incurred indiscriminately on behalf of the
service as a whole&mdash;being an indispensable condition for operation
of the property at all&mdash;that no logical distinction of
expense even as between passenger and freight traffic is possible.
This being so, how futile it is to expect to be able to set off the
expenses due to any particular portion either of freight or passenger
service, and especially to any individual shipment. It
may oftentimes be possible to determine the <i>extra</i> cost due to
individual shipments. This, of course, mainly applies to what
are called movement expenses. Thus the haulage cost of a
2,000-ton grain train from Chicago to New York has been estimated
at $520. But how small a part this is of the total cost,
the preceding analysis must have made clear. In the Texas
Cattle Raisers' case, detailed analysis of the extra cost for the
traffic in cattle was presented.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The starting point in this
attempt was necessarily an allocation of freight and passenger
expenditures, which, if defective, would vitiate the entire subsequent
calculation as to costs. In this instance, it was the
judgment of the Interstate Commerce Commission in its final
decision in 1908, that no such separation of expenditures was
possible as a basis for the determination of cost of service.</p>

<p>A railroad theoretically presents a clear example of an industry
subject to the law of increasing returns&mdash;that is to
say, an industry in which the cost of operation grows less
rapidly than the volume of business done. Each ton of freight
added to the existing traffic costs relatively less to haul. From
this it follows, obviously, that the net returns increase more
than proportionately with the expansion of traffic. This may
be demonstrated by a simple calculation. It has already been
shown that only about two-thirds of the total expenditures
of a railroad are applied to operation, the remaining third
being devoted to capital account. Moreover, of these two-thirds
of the total applied to operating outlay, only about
one-half responds to any change in the tonnage, the other half
being constant up to a certain point. Otherwise expressed,
an increase of one per cent, in traffic and, therefore, of revenue,
produces an increase in expense of only one-half of two-thirds
of one per cent.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Two-thirds of the entire increment of revenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>goes to profit. Carry this increase further and the effect is
more striking. Suppose traffic to grow tenfold. The former
outlay being $100 for a given volume of business, would be
divided according to our rule as follows: one-third for fixed
charges, one-third for constant operating outlay and one-third
for variable expenses. With ten times as much traffic, only
the last group of outgoes will expand. One thousand dollars
revenue would therefore become available under the new
conditions, to pay the same fixed charges as well as constant
operating costs. The total outgo would thus become $33 plus
$33 plus $330, or $396 in all. Almost two-thirds of the increment
of revenue still remains as profit. It might well happen
that such an expansion could not ensue without large increases
in the capital and plant, as has already been noted; but up to
that point this calculation would hold good. The following
statement varying but slightly from our foregoing assumptions,
illustrates the principle.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Let the distribution of expenditures

as much as for the pre&euml;xisting tonnage. Were the added cost
of each ton mile as great as before, the operating expenses
would rise by the full ten per cent. of $67. But on Webb's
assumption, they will rise by only forty per cent. of ten per
cent. The new account would then stand thus:</p>

<p>By an increase of ten per cent. in tonnage, balance for dividends
has more than doubled.</p>

<p>In this connection it will be noted that a constant rate of
return per unit of business newly acquired has been assumed.
Attempts were made on behalf of the railroads, during the
long period of decline of ton mile revenue down to 1900, by
Newcomb and others, to show that this is an unreasonable
assumption; in that increased traffic is presumably to be had
only by a progressive lowering of the rates charged. This
contention has been effectively demolished by the steady and
remarkable growth of traffic since 1900, even in the face of a
substantial rise of rates all along the line. A necessary corollary
to our proposition, beside that of the maintenance of a constant
scale of charges, is, of course, also of the continuance of a given
grade of service and of costs of operation. If more luxuriously
appointed passenger trains or quicker freight service have to
be given in order to produce the growth of business, the added
costs of operation must, naturally, be taken into consideration.
If widespread rise of wages follows an increase in the general
cost of living, that too is an entirely extraneous factor. But
with a given grade of service, constant rates and steady wage
scales, there can be no question, up to the point of full utilization
of the existing plant, that the operation of railroads affords
clear demonstration of the law of increasing returns.</p>

<p>The obverse side of the law of increasing returns is also of
great importance. For the same reason that when traffic increases,
only a portion of the expenses are affected, it follows
that, when business declines, only a part of the costs can be
lopped off. In other words, a reduction in the volume of traffic
does not in itself alone lead to a corresponding reduction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the operating expenses. Of course, many of these latter may,
as we have seen, be temporarily postponed, as they were in
1893-1897, especially in the group of maintenance-of-way
expenses. In such an event they must ultimately be made
good by extraordinary outlay at some later time. But, unless
they be thus postponed and unless the rates charged for service
be reduced in order to stimulate traffic, it is inevitable that the
margin of profit will drop as rapidly as it tends to rise with
increased volume of business. This may be illustrated by the
following computation.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Assume the total revenue from a
given business to be $100, and assume it to be distributed as
before, viz.:</p>

<p>A positive decline of ten per cent, in the tonnage, if the cost
for operation per unit of the portion lost was the same as the
rest, would obviously reduce the operating expenses also by ten
per cent. Let it next be assumed, as was done previously, that
the average extra cost per unit of the latest increment of business
was only forty per cent. as much as for the remainder of
the tonnage. How closely this will approximate the facts in
any particular instance will depend upon the density of traffic
attained in relation to the capacity of the existing plant. If
the addition of the last ten per cent. of business did not increase
the large proportion of fixed expenses at all, and only
added forty per cent. per unit more to the variable expenses;
per contra, the loss of it would merely reduce the variable expenses
and still leave the constant outlay the same. On this
assumption, by the loss of ten per cent. of business the total
amount of operating expenses under the new conditions would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be lessened, not by ten per cent. of $67, but by only forty per
cent. of ten per cent. of $67. The income would, however,
decline by the full amount of ten per cent. The account, after
a loss of ten per cent. of business, would then stand somewhat
as follows:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="The account, after a loss of ten per cent. of business">

<p>Or, in other words, a decline of ten per cent. in tonnage has
transmuted a five per cent. dividend condition into one involving
an actual deficit nearly half as great as the former profit.
The sudden reversal from apparent prosperity to very real
distress, such as occurred during the fall of 1907, is thus explained.
Its suddenness may be shown by the following table
of monthly gross and net earnings, promulgated by the Interstate
Commerce Commission.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The acute panic occurred

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></div>
<p>This table shows that whereas under full prosperity, up to and
including the month of October, the net revenue was about
thirty per cent. of gross; after the sharp decline in traffic, it
dropped in November to twenty-six per cent., and progressively
thereafter to twenty per cent. in January. In other
words, a decline of about one-fourth in the gross revenue within
four months, entailed a loss of over fifty per cent. in net earnings.
Higher operating expenses in the winter may have exaggerated
this tendency, but, on the other hand, drastic
economies were put into effect, which would more than offset
the difference.</p>

<p>The urgent need of at once meeting any loss of business by
prompt reduction of operating expenses is apparent. But there
is comfort to be found at this point in the fact that each one
per cent. saved in operation at any given time, results in saving
two per cent. for the net earnings. According to our estimates,
and as a rule practically, operating expenses equal about two-thirds
of gross revenue, leaving one-third to meet charges and
pay dividends. Every reduction from this two-thirds of gross
revenue, therefore, transferred to the balance, increases the
latter proportionately twice as much. This fact in turn explains
the urgent pressure always brought to bear at such
times to effect economies all along the line. These are too
often indiscriminately made.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Such paring down of expenses
should always be made with an eye to their ultimate effect
upon the operating efficiency of the property in the long run.
To postpone much-needed repairs of equipment during a period
of depression, like that of 1907-1908, when repair shop costs
are at a low ebb, only to hamper operations and to effect repairs
under pressure when business revives, is an instance of such
wasteful economy.</p>

<p>The qualification of the law of increasing returns as applied
to railroads, arising from the distinction between long and
short term production of its commodity&mdash;transportation&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>as
above described, is of course by no means confined to carriers
alone. It holds good of a factory or mercantile establishment
as well. But in the case of railways, it is emphasized by
the abruptness with which the condition of congestion of plant
arises. The limit of full working capacity in a factory is elastic,
by reason of the fact that under the "peak of load"&mdash;in busy
seasons&mdash;it may prolong operations beyond the daylight hours
or, at worst, work all night by double shifts. But a railroad,
customarily working by night as well as by day and thus distributing
its operations over the entire twenty-four hours,
enjoys no such expansible limits upon utilization of its plant.
When such full utilization is attained, the end comes suddenly.
No postponement to a more favorable time for raising funds
for better terminals or four tracking the main line is possible;
nor does its character as a public servant permit a railroad to
curtail service. The dead wall of congestion cannot be gotten
around by either path. A crisis is presented, calling for the
most heroic measures. This, of course, still further emphasizes
the need for a long look ahead into the future with respect to
railroad finance; not for the management alone, but for the
government as well, charged as it is at present with control
over rates for service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The application of the law of increasing returns to railroads
in actual practice is beset with difficulties. In order to make
these clear, it will be necessary first to describe the phenomenal
development of this country which has taken place during
the last two decades.</p>

<p>The freight service of the railroads of the United States,
measured by weight, in 1910, amounted to 1,026,000,000 tons.
Only since 1899 when the corresponding figure given by the
Interstate Commerce Commission was 501,000,000 tons, have
accurate data been obtainable. This would indicate a growth
in ten years of about one hundred per cent. But this figure
takes no account of the distance each ton of freight travels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
This factor is included in what is known as ton mileage&mdash;that
is to say, the equivalent of the number of tons of freight
carried one mile. Obviously, so far as the amount of service
rendered is concerned, one ton carried a hundred miles is the
equivalent of one hundred tons transported one mile. Every
carrier totalizes in this way each ton of freight movement by
multiplying it into the distance transported. For the United
States as a whole, this ton mileage in 1910 was 255,016,000,000&mdash;that
is to say, the service rendered would be represented by
the carriage of that number of tons one mile. The appended
diagram shows the phenomenal rapidity with which this transportation
service has grown since 1899. The scale on the
left hand side of the chart serves this purpose. The right
hand scale indicates the miles of line in operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 683px;">
<img src="images/illus096.jpg" width="683" height="506" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Relative Growth of Mileage and Traffic</p></div>
</div>

<p>The rapid growth up to 1893 was suddenly interrupted by
panic and subsequent industrial depression lasting for about
four years. Recovery began in 1897, since which time the
freight movement has increased by leaps and bounds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
about 95,000,000,000 ton miles to 255,016,000,000 ton miles in
1910. It is obvious that the growth of transportation in any
country is bound to be more rapid than the increase either
in population or in wealth. It appears, indeed, almost as if
the volume of transportation in the United States increased
more nearly as the square of population than in direct proportion.
It has been estimated that we forward two and a
half times as much freight <i>per capita</i> as some of the leading
European countries like France. Our domestic population
from 1890 to 1910 increased about fifty per cent. The railroad
mileage grew at about the same rate. Yet the freight service
surpassed this rate of growth more than six times over; and the
passenger service augmented nearly as much. Both alike in
1910 were practically three times as great in volume as twenty
years before. The diagram on page <a href="#Page_78">78</a> is intended to illustrate
the relative rapidity of this development. While population
and mileage increased about one half, the railroads in 1910
hauled the equivalent of three times the volume of freight traffic
handled in 1890. At the beginning of this period, the railroads
had to seek the freight. Now it appears that traffic normally
will seek the railroads. At times, even, as in 1906-1907, the
railroads have actually sought to escape the flood of business
presented.</p>

<p>The magnitude and importance of the growth of tonnage,
as above described, is revealed by the rapid increase in railroad
earnings. The course of these is shown by the succeeding
chart on page <a href="#Page_82">82</a>. Gross revenues of American railroads in
1889 were about one billion dollars. In 1910 they amounted
to $2,750,000,000. Thus it appears that gross earnings
almost equalled three times the amount of twenty years ago.
The net income available for dividends has grown even faster.
The increase was, roughly speaking, about five fold; namely,
from 101 millions in 1889 to 515 millions in 1910. Nearly
three and one-half times as much money went annually to the
owners of railroad securities as dividends and interest, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
leaving surplus earnings for 1910 of about 222 millions available
for improvements and surplus. But the limit of utilization
seems to have been about reached on many roads in 1906;
and an era of extensive new capital outlay to increase the
existing plants and facilities ensued. Indications are not
lacking to show that at the height of activity before the industrial
collapse of 1907-1908, such a point of saturation had been
reached, especially in trunk line territory and on the northern
transcontinental lines.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> On the Northern Pacific, for instance,
the ton mileage increased from 2.2 billions to 5.2 billions between
1900 and 1906. The Northwest was suddenly confronted at
that time with the new issue of enlarging facilities, which had
been slowly becoming apparent elsewhere in the country during
the preceding decade. Grain actually rotted on the ground,
and an acute coal famine occurred, because of sheer inability
of the roads to care for the new traffic. Changes in methods
of business also somewhat exaggerated this strain upon the
carriers. Merchants now expect quick delivery to order.
They object to stocking up months ahead, even when conditions
are auspicious; therefore, business, when especially stimulated,
comes with an irresistible rush. All these causes,
coupled with undiscriminating attempts by inadequately
bedded roads to imitate the methods of progressive ones by
prematurely increasing their train loads, led to a practical
breakdown of the transportation business of the country in
the autumn of 1906. To the student of transportation, this
congestion denoted the attainment of a point of saturation for
the then-existing physical plant. The analogy to the case of
the Pennsylvania Railroad, previously described, is obvious.
Such a predicament is bound to arise in the development of
any carrier in a rapidly growing country. Its fiscal significance
will appear in due time.</p>

<p>From this table it appears that between 1880 and 1906 the
ton mileage of freight increased about six fold, and the passenger
business more than four fold. Operating expenses, on the
other hand, were in 1906 less than four times as great as in
1880. Increasing returns are quite evident. The period from
1880 down to 1896-1898, before the recent general increases
in prices and wages took place, shows this even more strikingly.
In order to transport more than three times as much freight
and two and one-quarter times as many passengers, it required
a direct outlay for operation of little more than twice as much
money.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> On the other hand, owing to the rapid rise of all
operating costs since 1898, a comparison of expenditures confined
to the last ten years by themselves, affords an apparent
contradiction. The results for this period have already been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>given, classified in greater detail. And yet, despite this disturbing
factor and the one earlier mentioned that these later
operating expenses have been heavily loaded with improvement
expenditures, it appears by comparison of 1895 with 1905, that
passenger business has more than doubled, and freight business
is two and a half times as great, while operating expenses in
1905 were not much over twice their amount ten years before.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>EARNINGS &amp; EXPENSES</p></div>
</div>

<p>A comparison of the movement of gross earnings with
operating expenses introduces still another disturbing factor,
namely, the changes from year to year in the level of freight
rates as well as in the character of the traffic handled. The
effect of fluctuating costs of production of transportation having
just been considered, we may now turn to the fiscal returns
as affected by the price obtainable for the service given. Any
long-time comparison of results reflects the influence of the
steady decline of freight rates during the generation prior to
1900. Thus comparing 1880 with 1898, as shown by the preceding
table, operating expenses grew in the ratio of 100 to
221, while gross income grew from 100 to only 190. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
fold the freight business produced less than twice the revenue.
Pushing the comparison later, down to 1906, operating expenses
grew after 1880 from 100 to 394, while gross income rose to only
346. This reflects the influence during the last few years of
the rapid rise in prices and wages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>According to the opposite diagram, comparing 1890 with
1910, both operating expenses and gross income from operation
seem to have moved together; the curve of gross revenue rising
proportionately only a little faster than that for operating
expenses. The latter have risen from a general figure of
about $800,000,000 before the depression of 1893-1897, to
$1,822,000,000 in 1910; the former from about $1,200,000,000 to
over $2,750,000,000. Both alike somewhat more than doubled,
therefore, in twenty years. At times, especially during the rapid
revival of business after 1897, before rising prices began to affect
costs of operation, extraordinary increases in earnings appeared,
outstripping the growth of expenditures. Comparing the year
1899 with 1895 we find that the gross earnings of the railroads
of the United States increased by twenty-two per cent. This
involved an increased expense of operation, however, of only
eighteen per cent. Similar comparison year by year, there
having been an enormous expansion of business, shows an
increase in gross earnings somewhat more rapid than the growth
of operating expenses. This differential advantage has progressively
lessened since 1902, and especially since the let-up
in 1907. The official returns for 1911 with the marked decline
in gross, show an even more distinct drop in net earnings.
Whether the need of an increase of rates commensurate
with the augmented operating costs is imperative, can only be
ascertained after a return to more normal business conditions.</p>

<p>These relationships would be the more striking could we exclude
the enormous expenditures for betterments which have
been charged to operating expenses during these years. Comparisons
of net earnings are vitiated by uncertainty upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
point. Working over these results by comparison per mile
of line, it appears that the rate of increase in earnings per mile
of line for five years prior to 1900, was approximately double
the rate of increase of operating expenses per mile of line.
The greatly lessened cost of performing additional business
becomes at once apparent. But these latter conclusions, as has
been said, cover only a brief period of time. Judging by the
results over many years, it appears that changes both in the
level of freight rates and of wages and prices have operated to
leave the railroads not much better off than they were some
time ago. The only thing which has saved them whole in the
face of rising prices and wages since 1900, and especially since
1907, has been the rise of freight rates and the enforced improvements
in operation. With the methods of transportation,
such as size of cars and locomotives and train loads, as they
were a decade ago, very real distress would be more widely
apparent than it is. On the whole, the public seems to have
shared in the benefits of these improvements to a considerable
degree. This statement, however true for the entire railroad
system of the country as a whole, does not by any means represent
the facts for any single system. Moreover, it is not by
any means clear how fully the railroad system of the country
has been enlarged and improved out of surplus earnings. There
is reason to think that foundations in some cases&mdash;the Pennsylvania
road, for example&mdash;have been laid during these
prosperous years, for largely increased tonnage in the immediate
future without a corresponding growth of expenses chargeable
to plant; in other words, that the transition to a distinctly
higher grade of operation has been effected out of surplus
earnings.</p>

<p>The comparison of gross and net earnings from operation,
if expenditures have grown almost as fast as gross income,
confirms the preceding conclusions. Surveying the chart for
the period since 1890, it appears that net earnings for the railroads
of the United States have more nearly trebled than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
doubled; the increase having been 177 per cent. up to 1910.
This takes no account whatever of the immense volume of new
capital added to the system. The entirely distinct question
of the relative rate of return upon the investment will engage
our attention at a later time. Examination of the years of
rapid revival after 1897 by themselves, however, especially
for individual companies, shows striking results. This is especially
true of roads, not then developed up to a fair working
capacity for their plants.</p>

<p>An interesting comparison with the previous decade, 1870
to 1880, exemplifies this relation still further. The gross
earnings of the trunk lines of the United States decreased very
greatly per mile of line from $7,211 in fact to $6,636 during the
decade; but at the same time the net earnings steadily increased.
This was due primarily to the great volume of business developed,&mdash;the
ton mileage increasing more than three fold
during these ten years. It happened despite the fact that the
miles of line during the same period had more than doubled.
The following decade, 1880 to 1890, was represented by an
increase of only 82.7 per cent. in mileage, while the number
of tons of freight hauled one mile increased by 132 per cent.
Density increasing in this way, a corresponding ability to carry
at a lower rate per ton was a necessary result. So indisputably
has this law&mdash;that an expanding volume of business up to a
certain point, may profitably be carried at a continually lowered
cost&mdash;been proved, that it is estimated by so competent
an authority as the <i>Engineering Review</i> that, provided sufficient
tonnage be available for 2,000-ton freight train loads, a
cost of one mill per ton mile can be attained. Its significance
may be realized from the fact that the lowest revenue per ton
mile reported for the United States is 2.21 mills per ton mile
for the long haul soft coal business of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
This, of course, does not imply that any railroad in actual
operation, carrying all kinds of freight including a large pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>portion
of local traffic, can in the immediate future hope to
attain this result. It is intended only to show that, provided
the volume of traffic be large enough, the cost of operation
tends to decline as a matter of course, until a condition of congestion
for the existing plant has been reached. At this point
a new cycle of costs of operation and of profits makes its
appearance.</p>

<p>The most important single factor in the production of increasing
returns upon a railroad is the density of traffic; that
is to say, the amount of business which can be conducted with
a given set of rails, terminals and rolling stock. In other
words, it is the degree of effective utilization of the plant and
equipment. It is too obvious to need demonstration, after
what has been set forth concerning the nature of railroad expenditures,
that economy of operation and, consequently, profits
are more or less directly dependent upon this fact. Such
effective utilization of the property may be secured in two
ways: either by a large tonnage per mile of its line, or else
by a concentration of such traffic as it may have into large
train loads, which can individually be transported at low cost.
The first of these economizes the fixed expenses for roadway
and line which respond but slowly to enlargement of traffic, by
distributing them thinly over a large tonnage; the second
economizes the mere movement expenses which tend to grow
less rapidly than the size of the trains. For neither fuel consumption
nor wages of train crews expands <i>pari passu</i> with the
paying load. Fortunate the lot of the railroad which enjoys
both these advantages, of density of traffic per mile of line
and of tonnage capable of such concentration in heavy train
units.</p>

<p>Traffic density&mdash;the tons of freight carried one mile per
mile of line&mdash;is readily computed. The ton mileage, representing
the total transportation service, is merely divided by
the number of miles of line operated. The following graded
table illustrates the wide range of this figure, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

as well as the change in the last few years.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The first of these companies operates in a sparsely settled
agricultural territory. The St. Paul system lies nearer Chicago,
but is still largely dependent upon a local and rural constituency.
The Great Northern&mdash;a great transcontinental
trunk line&mdash;despite its sparsely settled western area, exchanges
a large volume of through freight for the Pacific Coast for lumber
and other bulky products carried east. The New Haven
serves perhaps the most densely settled area in the United
States, but much of its traffic is on branch lines and is of a retail
character. The Wabash lies in well settled territory and hauls
a heavy tonnage of low-grade freight. The last two are not
only great trunk lines to the seaboard, but also tap the coal
and iron fields. Much of their tonnage is consequently of low
grade. The Pennsylvania enjoys a still further advantage,
super-adding a rich local traffic in manufactures and merchandise.
As compared with its rival trunk line, the New York
Central, it hauls relatively little grain; but, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the New York Central has a much smaller coal and iron business.
Some one has aptly characterized the difference between the
two roads, describing the New York Central as "operating
between good points, but not through a good country" so far
as local business is concerned. On the one, through traffic is
supplementary to local business, while on the other it is the
reverse. The high density of trunk line traffic is such that
about two-thirds of all the tonnage of the United States is
transported east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio river.</p>

<p>Traffic density has enormously increased during the last
two decades, as a result of the filling up of the country and
the relative cessation of new construction. This is manifested
by the growth since 1890. In that year the density was
less than 500,000 ton miles per mile of line, and during the
depression of 1893 it fell well below that figure. The total of
1,053,000 reported for 1911 represents, therefore, more than a
doubling of the density in twenty years. This growth during
1898 and 1905-'06 was notable. The latter period, especially,
was a time when congestion upon all the roads of the country
occasioned much distress. The fact is evident that the country
has well grown up to the measure of its existing transportation
facilities.</p>

<p>The second measure of effective operation for the production
of increasing returns, is concentration in the trainload.
This is regarded by many as the supreme test of efficiency in
management. Great progress has been made during the past
years in this regard in the United States&mdash;an improvement
which has largely enabled the carriers to bear up under an
increasing burden of expenditure. The trainload is generally
adopted today as the unit of operation, measuring the cost of
service.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is a fact that, within certain limits, the cost of
handling a train does not vary greatly with its capacity.
Since the first application of air-brakes to freight trains in 1887,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>a train crew sufficient to handle fifteen cars can care for thirty
about as well in long haul wholesale business. Fuel cost, also,
as has been shown, lags well behind the rate of increase of the
load. Eaton in his Railroad Operations, concludes that from
thirty to fifty per cent. of cost is independent of the trainload.
The effect is that any increment in the paying load very
materially decreases the cost of operation per ton.</p>

<p>Progress in the United States in increasing the average train
load is shown by the lowest curve on the diagram on page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_97">97</a>.
The scale applicable is along the left hand side of the chart.
From 175 tons per train in 1890 to an average figure of
383.10 in 1911 is certainly a remarkable showing. The most
rapid increase seems to have occurred after 1897, with the first
resumption of general prosperity. As for individual roads,
the following table of average train loads is suggestive, as
showing the gradation between roads of different type, as well
as progress from year to year:</p>

<p>The great coal and iron roads, the trunk lines and the transcontinental
lines all concentrate their business; while the granger
roads, like the Atchison and North Western, the roads with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
much local business like the New Haven or the Southern,
operating in sparsely settled regions, all have of necessity
smaller trainloads. But all alike betray remarkable progress
in this regard. In 1870 the average for the best roads was little
above 100 tons,&mdash;such as 103 tons reported for the New York
Central and 137 tons on the Lake Shore. From this level to
results of 400 or 500 tons on the average represents a notable
achievement. The Lake Shore for 1911 reports a revenue train
load of 635 tons. It should be observed, however, that such
results come from longer trains, not, apparently, so much from
larger cars. To raise the average trainload on the Wabash
from 196 tons in 1890 to 386 tons in 1908 is also worthy of
note. The significance of these recent figures can be realized
from the fact that the London &amp; North Western, one of the
leading railroads in Great Britain, reports recently an average
freight train load of only 68 tons. This represents probably
a fair average for European railroads as a whole, although in
England the general practice of privately owned cars, of light
locomotives, short freight sidings, etc., may reduce the figure
slightly below the continental average. Statistics not only show
the notable improvement in recent years; they at the same
time show how the trainload performance is affected by trade
conditions. For nearly every road the trainloads for 1904
were distinctly lower than in the preceding years. This was a
year of acute business depression. The movement of great
staple commodities, such as iron ore, coal, steel and iron and
lumber, was greatly curtailed. All business was conducted on
a narrower basis. Smaller trainloads were an almost inevitable
consequence. The revival in the following year, however,
immediately improved the conditions of operation, as the figures
indicate.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the figures for the American roads
above given represent averages. These are compounded from
local and through traffic taken together. It is apparent at
once that local trains must average far lighter loads than are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
customary upon long hauls without breaking bulk. Thus
New England railroads report for 1906 an average trainload
of only 220 tons, while other parts of the country, such as
the North Central group, report 426 tons of paying load. Only
by separation of local from through business can we adequately
appreciate the enormous advances which have taken place
in railroad operation in the United States, with corresponding
reductions in the cost of transportation. While the New
York Central at one time reported an average trainload of
322 tons, the average load of its through trains on the main
line rose as high as 750 tons. More than twice this figure is
attained upon the Pittsburg, Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie road in
hauling ore from the lakes to the furnaces at Pittsburg. The
Illinois Central, for its low grade and long haul to the Gulf,
has recently built locomotives capable of hauling 2,000 tons
of net paying load. A standard grain train on the Lake Shore
in 1903 consisted of fifty cars holding forty tons each. Even
this figure has recently been surpassed by the New York Central,
which, with its monster new "mogul" engines, hauls eighty
loaded 30-ton cars, giving 2,400 tons of revenue freight. The
Mallet locomotives with a tractive effort of 100,000 lbs., at
present seem to have reached the limit of size and weight.
Seventy-five grain cars holding 1,000 bushels apiece are equivalent
to the production of twenty bushels per acre of an area
of six square miles. This is an ordinary trainload. It is not
infrequent to transport a fifth more than this. Eighty and
even one hundred cars in a train since 1900 often bring the
load up to 3,600 and even 4,000 tons of freight. Such a train
is over four-fifths of a mile long. From these figures it certainly
appears that trainloads for long haul are standardized at not
less than 2,000 tons, a figure which would have seemed absolutely
impossible to railroad managers of fifteen or twenty
years ago. The maximum trainload in Germany on coal
traffic, which, of course, greatly exceeds any general average
for trains of all classes, is about five hundred tons. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
regarded as a notable achievement that this represents an
increase of about one hundred tons in the last decade.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the extravagant promises of economy
from large trainloads have been considerably abated of late.
It has been effectively demonstrated that there is a limit to such
growth. Only low-grade and long haul carload traffic can
profitably be concentrated. In 1903, for instance, a general
decrease in trainloads followed a reduction in the relative
amounts of low as compared with high grade tonnage. Less
iron, coal, and raw materials and more merchandise and manufactures
offered for carriage, necessitated a positive reduction
in the trainloads as already mentioned. Nor can local business
in less than carload lots profitably be concentrated beyond a
certain point. Grades must be uniform to attain such economy.
The trainload must not exceed the traction power on the heaviest
inclines, or else expensive pusher engines or breaking up of
trains will offset all other savings. Moreover, too great trainloads
even on the best roadbeds involve slower speeds. Not
only is other traffic thus impeded, but the economy in wages
vanishes after a certain point with such slower movement.
The fashion had been set by James J. Hill, the master mind in
the transcontinental field. His notable results, due to a careful
working out of every detail, led to a frenzied imitation on all
sides. Many roads then discovered to their loss that while
they had provided rolling stock for heavy loading, ampler terminals,
longer sidings and heavier bridges also were a necessary
accompaniment. Part of the congestion of traffic in 1906-1907,
already mentioned, and a portion of the financial embarrassments
of recent years, were undoubtedly due to too great haste
in seeking economies of this sort in rolling stock, without at
the same time making provisions for enlargement of other
portions of the plant. A more discriminating policy has consequently
resulted of late. Traffic is being sorted according
to its availability for concentration. The best utilization of
the rails and terminals is being more considered. Business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
demands for quick delivery also enter into the calculation.
Instead of a few huge slow-moving leviathans blocking other
trains, the line may perhaps better be kept full of many
smaller trains moving more nearly together. Such are certain
of the details now being worked out. None of them,
however, weaken the main proposition that a discriminating
concentration of traffic conduces very greatly to economy of
operation.</p>

<p>This concentration of traffic units is largely due to technical
improvements of various kinds. Foremost among these has
been the development of the steel rail. In 1880 more than
seven-tenths of our mileage was still equipped with iron rails.
Rapid progress ensued during the next ten years, upward of
eighty per cent. being in steel rails by 1890. At the present
time, the proportion is above ninety-eight per cent. In fact,
no iron rails have been made for many years, except for repairs
and on insignificant branch lines in remote parts of the country.
A steady increase in the weight of the rails has ensued. The
standard rail for main lines until the Civil War weighed fifty-six
pounds to the yard. In the seventies this was increased to
sixty-three and above; in the latter eighties the best practice
was to use seventy-five pound sections. Since 1900, they
frequently run as high as one hundred pounds, in regions of
dense traffic. Few main lines of track now average less than
seventy-five pounds. It is this increase in the use and size of
steel rails which has permitted improvements in rolling stock.
But, on the other hand, grave dissatisfaction with the quality
of the rails manufactured of late years, particularly since the
establishment of practical monopoly under the United States
Steel Corporation has become manifest. Numerous accidents
due to breakage of rails, especially since 1905, have revealed
either defects in manufacture or an undue load imposed by
heavier rolling stock, too high speed, or both. The matter
has become steadily worse. In 1902 the Interstate Commerce
Commission ascribed seventy-eight accidents to broken rails.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Nine years later the number had risen to 249. The need of
improvement is now fully recognized on all sides.</p>

<p>The power and efficiency of locomotives has increased, perhaps,
more since 1890, and particularly since 1895, than in any
previous period. Superior materials particularly have contributed
to this result, such as the substitution of cast steel
for cast iron and of nickel steel for wrought iron in axles, crank
pins, etc. Some of the improvements which may be mentioned
are, for instance, an increase in the average heating surface
from 2,000 in 1890 to nearly 3,000 square feet at the present
time, and an increase in the average steam pressure from 160
pounds to 210 pounds per square inch in the same period. The
maximum weight has also increased very rapidly. The average
weight of a locomotive at the close of the Civil War was
approximately 90,000 pounds. This has increased in somewhat
the following proportions: To 1881, 102,000 lbs.; to
1893, 135,000 lbs.; to 1895, 148,000 lbs.; to 1898, 230,000 lbs.;
rising in 1900 to 250,000 lbs. Passenger locomotives since
1892 have almost doubled in weight, and freight engines have
more than done so. Compound and double or Mallet locomotives
are also supplanting those of simpler type for peculiarly
heavy service. The first compound engine was built in 1899,
only one being constructed in that year. In 1900 a single
locomotive works turned out 500&mdash;a number constituting
two-thirds of the entire output of that company&mdash;for use in
the United States. Such locomotives cost more in first instance;
but the greater weight and steam capacity, together
with the considerable saving in fuel, amounting to perhaps
twenty per cent., more than offset this objection. The traction
efficiency of these improved locomotives may be shown by the
statement that in 1885 the decapod Baldwin locomotives,
made to haul 3,600 tons on a level, represented the maximum
capacity. Five years later the same company built locomotives
to haul 4,000 tons, not only on a level, but on any ordinary
grade. As indicative of late advances in locomotive construc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>tion,
we may instance those built about 1900 for the Illinois
Central and the Union Railroad at Pittsburg, both low-grade
roads, carrying exceedingly heavy train loads. The first
of these weighed, including its tender, 365,000 lbs., the Union
Railroad consolidation engines weighing 334,000 lbs. Such
locomotives are stated to be twice as powerful as the best which
were manufactured twenty-five years ago. This record is surpassed
by engines which have just been built for pusher service
on the soft-coal Virginian Railway. They are of the Mallet
type, weighing 540,000 pounds; with a train capacity of 4,230
tons. The evaporative surface is 6,760 square feet. As summarizing
the increased efficiency of American locomotives, we
may instance the figures of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
showing the average performance of locomotives for the
United States. Whereas in 1894 the average number of tons
of freight carried per locomotive was about 32,000 tons, this
rose to 46,000 tons in 1899, and to 54,600 tons in 1906. At the
same time the number of tons of freight hauled one mile for each
freight locomotive in the United States increased from 4,000,000
in 1894 to approximately 6,000,000 in 1899, and to 7,300,000
in 1910. In other words, the average performance of each
freight locomotive in the United States has increased by more
than fifty per cent. in the last decade.</p>

<p>The economy of large freight cars has been amply demonstrated.
Marked advances in the average capacity have
taken place in the last few years. In the sixties a 15,000
pound freight car represented about the normal capacity.
This has increased, as measured by maximum load, to 28,000
pounds in 1873; to 40,000 pounds in 1875; to 60,000 pounds
in 1885; to 70,000 pounds in 1895; while at the present time
80,000 to 100,000 pound cars are in everyday use. Cars of
this latter type, built to carry forty to fifty tons, are necessarily
of pressed steel construction, and are mainly useful for the
carriage of coal and ore and similar low-grade commodities.
It seems to be questionable whether a maximum capacity has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
not been about reached, in view of the exceedingly great wear
and tear imposed upon track, bridges, etc. Up to this point
the economy of heavy loading is indisputably proved. Increased
size of cars far more than proportionately increases the
paying load. Thus, for instance, an 18,000-pound car will
carry 20,000 pounds load, while a 22,000-pound car will carry
a load twice as great. It is stated on good authority, for
example, that a car of forty tons capacity can be built which
will weigh but 3,000 pounds more than a thirty-ton car, and
cost hardly fifty dollars more. This is undoubtedly the reason
why at the present time the average load per car is at least
one hundred per cent. greater than the maximum which was
possible twenty years ago.</p>

<p>A steady increase in the freight performance of American
equipment is shown by official data of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Whereas in 1894 it required on an average
1,888 freight cars for every 1,000,000 tons of freight transported
their capacity has so increased that the same amount of traffic
in 1906 was carried by only 1,127 cars. In other words, an
enormous increase in the freight service had been attained.
On the other hand, the actual mileage performance of much of
this equipment is extraordinarily low. It averages only about
9,000 miles annually or an equivalent of thirty miles a day.
At a speed of fifteen miles an hour, this means that actual
movement under a paying load, allowing for one-third of its
journeyings empty, occupies but little over an hour and a
quarter a day. The actual performance is, however, not quite
as poor as appears. For, of course, this average includes the
non-movement of all cars in bad order (sometimes one-tenth
of the total); and also all idle equipment. This latter consideration
is of great moment. Special cars, suitable only for
seasonal business; and especially demurrage delays, often
forty-eight hours or more, adversely affect the result. Where
separate mileage records of "foreign" cars are kept, as on the
Wabash system, it appears that their mileage is twice as high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
as for "home" cars. The difference is due to the fact that cars
off their own rails, mainly are in actual demand and are kept
moving. Probably the daily performance of loaded cars is
not less than 150 miles. But a journey of this length, with two
days' delay at each end at terminals, would bring the average
down to about thirty miles. The public does not always
appreciate these facts; and is often querulous. It is certain
that the problem how to secure greater efficiency in the use of
this equipment is as yet imperfectly solved.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Revenue and Cost Per Train Mile.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The discussion of the nature of railroad expenditure may be
concluded by a comparison of the net effects of the developments
of the last few years; that is to say, of steadily expanding
costs of operation and of slowly and tardily rising rates
chargeable for service on the one hand, as over against the
results obtained by mechanical improvements and increasing
economy of operation coupled with growth of tonnage, on the
other. The average cost of transportation has greatly increased.
This, according to the statistics of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, is shown upon the diagram herewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
by the middle curve.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The average cost of running all trains
per mile, which had fallen from 96 cents in 1891 to 91.8 cents
in 1895, rose to $1.07 in 1900, and in 1911 increased by more
than one-third, to $1.54 per mile. Against this should be set
the fact that while the trains thus cost more to haul per mile,
their paying load has increased in somewhat smaller proportion.
This is shown by the upper curve on the diagram above
mentioned. For freight trains the increase has been from $1.65
to $2.89 per mile. Passenger revenues per train mile have
increased less rapidly. This follows from the well-known fact
that freight rates have been increased, while passenger rates
have not changed for the better during this period; and also
that economies in concentration of traffic are necessarily confined
to the carriage of freight. The immense gain in trainloads
has probably been the main element, among these, as already
observed.</p>

<p>Among other things this diagram also brings out the effect
upon revenue of the substantial rate increases after 1900,
coupled with the elimination of rebate losses. It will be observed
how sharply the upper curve of revenue per train
mile slants upward after 1899, by comparison with the lower
line denoting cost. The same thing apparently occurs again
after the set-back of 1907.</p>

<p>The interrelation between these various factors may be
more readily shown by confining our attention to the period
during which a practically uninterrupted development of business
ensued, thus eliminating the confusion due to the four
years of depression after 1893. The data on our various charts
for the years 1898-1906 demonstrate that during this period the
ton mileage, measuring the freight traffic handled, has practically
doubled. To transport this doubled tonnage, a growth in
freight train mileage of only eighteen per cent. was necessary.
This was due, of course, to the notable concentration of train
loading, already described, as well as to a density of traffic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
per mile of line almost sixty per cent. greater. As a consequence
of these economies in operation, the revenue per freight
train mile has increased by about fifty per cent.; while the
average cost of running all trains per mile has grown less rapidly,
namely, by 42 per cent. Had we data for freight trains alone
it would surely be lower than this. In the meantime during
this period of eight years, the rate of return in revenue per ton
mile received, remained practically unchanged.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> From all
of which it would appear that even despite all these confusing
factors, the law of increasing returns, so far at least as 1898-'06
was concerned, was making itself appreciably felt.</p>

<p>Attentive consideration of the available figures, especially
as shown by diagram on page <a href="#Page_97">97</a>, shows apparently that the
various economies in operation, heavier trainloads and the
like, have not since 1906 yielded any greater profit from mere
operation, with the ever increasing volume of business. In
other words, the increase in the margin between cost of operation
and revenue per train mile,&mdash;measuring profitableness
per unit of movement&mdash;has not kept pace with the augmentation
of the size of that unit,&mdash;the trainload. Thus it follows,
as one would expect, even making allowance for all changes in
rates, wages and other expenses, that the law of increasing
returns as applied to railroads, does not arise primarily from
economic considerations as to mere physical operation. The
law originates primarily in the fiscal conditions attaching to
the heavy capital investment,&mdash;the fact, namely, that fixed
charges up to a given point of saturation tend to remain constant,
absolutely; but become proportionately less, therefore,
as the volume of business expands. From this fact,
therefore, rather than because of any marked economies of
large-scale production, may it be affirmed that railroads offer
a notable example of the law of increasing returns. The important
bearing of this distinction will appear in due time in
connection with the problem of the determination of reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
rates. Added significance, also, is given to the relation between
the cost of new capital, measured by the rates of interest
on bonds and dividends on stocks, and the supply necessary
to provide adequate extensions and improvements in future.</p>


<h3><i>Appendix</i>:</h3>

<p>The subjoined chart, reproduced by the <i>Railway Age Gazette</i>
from a bulletin of the Bureau of Railway Economics, brings out
forcibly the manner in which, within the short time limits of full
utilization of plant, a large increase of business can take place without
a commensurate growth of expenses. The phenomenon for railroads
is of course cyclical. Annually, as here indicated for 1911, the second
half of the year is marked by a much heavier movement of traffic,
principally, of course, the crops. But expenses never rise in proportion.
This is most evident for the eastern group of roads, as here shown.
This causes the net revenue curve, also, to vary much more than in
proportion to the volume of traffic, in consequence.</p>

<p>The task of constructing a freight or passenger tariff is
an eminently practical one. The process must be tentative
and experimental. Little can be calculated in advance. Tariffs
are not made out of hand; they grow. Not until a rate has
been put into effect, can its results be known. The lower
limit of charges, however, is more or less fixed. Obviously
the rate must not be less than that portion of the variable
expenses incident to each particular unit of business. This
variable expense is divisible into two parts, one for loading
and unloading, and the other for actual movement. The first
step in constructing a tariff, therefore, is to separate these
two portions of the variable outgo. General experience fixes
the terminal outlay for loading and unloading at an average
figure of about twenty or twenty-five cents per ton at each
end of the line; that is to say, at an average of about two and
one-half cents per hundred pounds as the total terminal cost.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Just where, above or below this average, the figure for any
particular tariff will lie, depends upon a multitude of details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>This terminal expense is obviously quite independent of the
length of the haul. It costs no more to load for a carriage of
3,000 miles than for one between two adjoining stations. It
is the second portion of the specific costs, namely, the movement
expense, which varies with the distance. This movement
cost is more difficult of determination, as affected by a multitude
of variable factors, such as the grades, curvature, number
of stops, the size of train load, and above all, the volume of
the traffic. Assuming the simplest physical conditions, one
would expect the movement expense, aside from the initial
cost of getting up steam in order to move at all, to rise proportionately
to the distance traversed. Graphically represented,
the tariff would appear somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus120.jpg" width="700" height="377" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Relation of Cost of Carriage to Distance.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In this diagram the distances of carriage are represented
along the horizontal line, A B; while the rate charged is laid
off vertically. The distances A C and E B represent the constant
terminal cost; while the steadily rising rates with increasing
distance, due to movement expenses, are shown by the sloping
dotted line C D. This chart at once demonstrates why under
the very simplest physical conditions a straight mileage tariff
is unscientific and unreasonable. For the constant terminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
expense, spread evenly over the mileage traversed as the movement
expenses grow, becomes progressively less and less in proportion
to the total of the two, which constitutes the real rate.
The longer the haul, the lower the ton-mile cost as a matter of
necessity. As Chanute calculated on the New York Central
a generation ago,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> while the average cost per mile of hauling a
ton ten miles was 4.062 cents, it descended progressively to
less than one cent per mile for distances over five hundred miles.
A common rule is that the rate rises as the square root of the
distance, rather than in proportion to it. A hundred-mile haul
represents a cost approximately only twice as great as one of
twenty-five miles, instead of being four times as much. For
thrice a given cost the haul may be increased nine times. The
course of such a tariff with increasing distance would be represented
by the parabolic curved lines on the preceding diagram.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The particular curve would depend upon the commodity and
local physical conditions. In territory where movement
expenses were heavy or operation difficult, the curve would
obviously rise more rapidly. Such a mathematical tariff does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>not depart widely from the one traced by the heavy dotted
line C D first described. The progressive decline of the per
mile rate with increasing distance may be illustrated by the
rough estimate of allowing two and one-half cents per hundred
weight or fifty cents per ton for terminal cost, with one-half
cent additional per mile for movement expenses. For a ten-mile
haul this would cost fifty-five cents, or an average of 5.5
cents per mile. Were the distance 500 miles, the average cost
would be only (50+250)/500 cents or 0.6 cents per ton mile.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Diagram of Belgian Tariff Sheets.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus far the problem has been seemingly simple. The next
step introduces new complications. Our hypothetical railway
line at a point one hundred miles out, may cross a navigable
river or canal, or may intersect another railway. Engineering
considerations of absolute cost of operation now no longer
predominate. Relative costs by rival lines enter into the case.
Water lines or more direct railways compete for the traffic.
One cannot even fall back upon the cost of carriage by any of
these lines, either the weaker or the stronger. An entirely new
principle comes into play. The alternative is presented of
taking the business at a rate lower than, and out of line with,
rates on general traffic, rather than to lose it to another line.
At first sight it would appear that it were better to abandon
the traffic than to take it for less than a fair average return or
profit. This is a serious matter. The tonnage offered is large.
The existence of active competition for it, is proof of its importance.
Railways meet at large towns, and large towns become
larger because the roads meet there. The main reason for
not abandoning the traffic, however, arises from that primary
fact, to which one constantly recurs, that all expenses are not
alike in their nature. A concrete example will make this plain.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, the normal rate to yield a fair average
return, all expenses considered, be thirty cents per hundredweight.
Two-thirds of the cost of this, or twenty cents, would
not cease as outgo, were this business abandoned. The rails
would rust, the ties would rot, and trains would move but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
lighter loads, and the fixed charges would still go on inexorably
night and day. Ten cents per hundredweight will meet the
variable and extra cost incident to this particular business.
A fifteen-cent rate would at least repay these extra outlays. It
would do more. It would contribute five cents per hundred
pounds to the twenty cents outgo per hundredweight, which,
without the traffic, would have to be borne <i>in toto</i>. Even a
rate of eleven cents would contribute something to this end.
For it would leave a surplus of one cent per hundredweight
to lighten the other burden. Adopting Hadley's phraseology,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
if you take at eleven cents, freight that costs you thirty cents
to handle, you lose nineteen cents on every hundredweight. If
you refuse to take it at that rate, you lose twenty cents on
every hundredweight you do <i>not</i> carry. For your constant
expenses go on, while the other road gets the business. There
is only one course open. The rate at the competitive point
must be cut; if not to make a profit, at least to stop a greater
loss. And one comfort may be uncovered in so doing. The
lowered rate may so stimulate new business and enlarge the
volume of traffic, that it may be handled at much lower cost.
In fact, this consideration alone in absence of all competition,
may induce a lowering of rates at certain points out of line
with the general schedule. This incentive, conditioned by the
fact of increasing returns, is always in the background. The
destiny of many places is manifested in terms beyond the
control of the carrier. Soil may be poor, climate or population
adverse to progress. But some particular places enjoy peculiar
advantages for growth. Not to stimulate new business at these
points where traffic might be cultivated, even without rivals in
the field, is little better than allowing it to escape over a competitor's
line of rails, were they present.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Effect of Competition at Certain Places on Rates.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Cutting the normal rate at competitive points or at important
points in order to stimulate traffic, in conformity with
the principle above stated, transforms our tariff diagram as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>shown herewith. The rate rises steadily with the increasing
distance from A, except at E and F. At these points it is fixed
at a lower point, determined not primarily by the cost of service
at all, but by the available demand for it. Traffic at these
points is charged what it will bear; not as much but as little
as it will bear: which, being translated, means that the charge
is set as high as possible, still holding the volume of business
constant, or even increasing it if that can be accomplished.
The total profit is constituted of the profit per unit of freight
multiplied into its volume. The centre of interest is here
shifted from the average profit per unit considered alone, to
the total profit thus obtained. At this point another difficulty
presents itself. Although, as set forth elsewhere, local discrimination,&mdash;charging
a lower rate for a more distant point,&mdash;may
sometimes not only be not injurious but actually beneficial
to all parties concerned, it is the exception, not the rule.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Ordinarily
to accord a remote point a lower rate without patent
cause, is an economic anomaly, and, moreover, a political
blunder. It violates the democratic principle of cost of service
as underlying rate schedules. Most legislative bodies have
prohibited it by law. The United States and most of the
American commonwealths do not permit it, other than in exceptional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>cases. The result is that on our hypothetical tariff,
the rates from A to points intermediate between A and B and
B and D must be cut to the levels, E and F, fixed for those
latter places. Such was the action taken by the trunk lines
in 1887 in conformity with the requirements of the long and
short haul clause of the Federal Act to Regulate Commerce.
An original progressively rising tariff is thus at once transformed
to a series of level grades or platforms, the shifts of level
corresponding to the location of large towns or competitive
centres; and the grade of each platform being fixed by the
rate determined under competition at those points.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This ascending
series of grades may be most irregular, as conditioned
by local circumstances. The general steepness of the gradation
is low on eastern roads like the New York Central, with
a large volume of traffic and easy operating conditions. On
western lines like the Denver and Rio Grande, in rugged territory,
with a sparse population and light tonnage, the per mile
rate rises rapidly and the gradation of the general tariff is steep.
But always it will be found that the changes in rates occur at
competitive points, with transition to a new level of rates
determined by the conditions at the next competitive point
beyond.</p>

<p>An important fact concerning this tariff thus far developed,
is that, of course, the height of the upper level at the most remote
point must never exceed what the particular traffic will bear.
In other words, supposing that the traffic consist of grain or
coal, not more than a certain amount could ever be charged,
no matter how great the distance, without so far diminishing
the profit in the transaction as to render the business impossible.
This is shown by the diagram opposite the next page, whereon
it appears that each commodity, coal, wheat, cement, lumber,
or oil, having attained a certain level of rates, never rises thereafter,
no matter what the distance. Each attains the maxi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>mum
of what it will bear. That level it can never exceed.
This immediately leads to another consideration. No single
tariff is applicable to any large number of commodities. Each
one must be regarded as a law unto itself. Not only does the
ultimate amount which each is able to bear depend upon the
value of that commodity, but also the conditions determining
competition with respect to it must be different all along the
line.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>[<i>Facing page <a href="#Page_108">108</a></i>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>Thus it appears that the height of the extreme upper level
in our diagrammatic series of rates is fixed by the highest
charge which that particular traffic will bear.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Beyond a certain
point, no matter how great the distance, the rate cannot be
increased above this level. This maximum varies, of course,
with each commodity. On cotton it may be fifty-five cents
per one hundred pounds; on grain or coal it will be much lower,
and on sand or cement lower still. The problem of the traffic
manager is to attain this highest rate as speedily as possible
with increasing distance, and to grade his rates with distance
up to this level as quickly as possible, consistent, of course,
with maintenance of a full volume of business. But not only
may the final limit of what the traffic will bear be different for
each commodity; the steps or stages by which the rate progresses
up to this maximum, are quite independently determined.
The actual tariffs of local class rates in general are much simpler
than the commercial conditions of rate making often warrant.
Probably the major portion of tonnage on American railways
moves under special or commodity rates. Even in Prussia
over three-fifths of the traffic is of this exceptional sort. These
special rates are made with a view to particular circumstances
prevalent at the time. Bids from a quarryman in Vermont on
stone for a public building in Chicago, may be dependent upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>the grant of a low rate on his marble in competition with a
quarry in North Carolina, also able to supply the particular
stone required. The various ascending series of rates are thus
rendered bewilderingly complex. This is also shown by the
foregoing diagram of rates between St. Paul and Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The
rate on a cheap, heavy commodity like coal, probably rises
rapidly at first, and soon attains a maximum beyond which it
can never go. On this diagram, for instance, the freight rate
on soft coal for points up to 180 miles out is lower than that
on flour. Beyond that point the coal rate in turn exceeds
that on flour. Cement is higher than lumber for the first 150
miles; but after that point the relatively greater value of lumber
holds it steadily above cement. On heavy cheap commodities
the relatively high cost of cartage in competition
enables the railway to reap the full measure of its advantage
and to charge well up to the maximum of what the traffic
will bear, within a comfortably short distance. Furthermore,
variable costs for terminal charges have to be considered.
Wherever they are high the rate must rise at once sufficiently
to cover these, no matter how short the distance; but thereafter
the rate may not need to be increased greatly for some
time. On light higher-grade goods the wagon is an effective
competitor for longer distances.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Moreover, the competitive
points at which rates rise from stage to stage are seldom the
same for all classes of goods. A river crossing brings competition
for coal, lime, or cement, but does not affect the rates
chargeable on high-class freight which seldom goes by water
in any event. A railway specially interested in the development
of some particular industry, wherever it crosses our
hypothetical line, effectively holds down the rate on the product
of that business. Junction points with other railways
having no such interest may have no influence upon that rate,
but may cause modifications in other directions. Another rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>way
being in need of back loads over its line, as the result of
a predominant movement, let us say, of beef cattle at certain
seasons of the year, may introduce competition in all the tonnage
capable of being carried on cattle cars. Such a road holds
down the rates on this traffic wherever it happens to cross,
but has no effect upon any other rate. Thus it comes about
in practice, as the last diagram well illustrates, that the tariff
lines cross and recross one another, generally rising with increasing
distance, but at all sorts of different times and places.</p>

<p>Few generalizations are possible in this connection. Rate
making must in a growing country ever be a matter of infinite
detail. It is generally true, however, that beyond a certain
point the tariff on different grades of commodities will separate
more and more widely with increasing distance. For,
obviously, after the low-grade goods have reached the maximum
which they can bear&mdash;and this they tend to do speedily&mdash;they
must remain practically constant; while those of higher grade
continue progressively rising. And for very short distances
the rate on the low-grade goods may even exceed that imposed
upon higher-class tonnage. The coal rate for a ten-mile haul
may exceed that upon some commodity worth twice as much;
but for a 200-mile haul the coal rate may be only one-eighth
of the rate on the other goods. Long experience on the part
of the carriers has, however, enabled them to arrange their
tonnage in classes; for each of which the conditions are more
or less uniform. By reserving the exceptional traffic for
special treatment under commodity rates, a fairly consistent
scheme of charges, rising by stages with increasing distance
may be evolved.</p>

<p>Few standard railway tariffs in the United States develop
beyond the point covered by the preceding paragraph. Many
of them are unable even to reach this stage of logical growth.
In the South, for instance, they have never got beyond the
stage of progressively rising local rates, with independent and
often radically reduced charges at all large towns or com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>petitive
points.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Each traffic manager, particularly since the
effective prohibition of working agreements between competing
lines by the Trans-Missouri Freight Association decision
of the Supreme Court in 1896, has been left to work out his
own salvation, not aided by, but in spite of, the efforts of his
rivals. There is, nevertheless, one example of further development
in the so-called trunk line territory, lying east of
the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers.
Conditions here, in general, are most favorable by comparison
with the West and South. Both population and traffic are
dense, and the state legislatures are conservative in making
grants for the construction of new lines. The companies are
historically mature. The good fruits of co&ouml;peration had
already appeared in the evolution of a scientific and logical
scheme, long before such co&ouml;perative action had been frowned
upon by the law and the courts. All the railways in trunk
line territory have worked in harmony, so far as general
classified local tariffs are concerned&mdash;however much they may
have fought one another over differentials to seaboard cities,
or export and import rates. Their system is comparatively
simple in principle, although it has required the experience
of many years to work out in detail. Fully described elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
it will suffice for present purposes to say that all rates
from intermediate points between Chicago and New York, are
fixed at a definite proportion of the Chicago-New York rate
both for east-and westbound shipments. Thus, for instance,
as shown by the map of trunk line rate distribution, at page <a href="#Page_365">365</a>,
the rate from Detroit to New York is seventy-two per cent.
of the Chicago-New York rate. The percentages from the
following points are as indicated, namely: Cincinnati, eighty-seven
per cent.; Indianapolis, ninety-three per cent.; Grand
Rapids, ninety-six per cent.; Peoria, Ill., one hundred and ten
per cent.; Louisville, Ky., one hundred per cent.; Milwaukee,
one hundred per cent.; and even points in Canada, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Toronto, seventy-eight per cent., etc. Every place, no matter
how small, has a certain percentage of the New York-Chicago
rate assigned to it. This rate changes with any variation of the
standard or basic charge. Thus when the Chicago-New York
rate, first-class, is seventy-five cents, the rate from Indianapolis
is ninety-three per cent. of that figure. Any change of Chicago-New
York first-class rates modifies every intermediate rate in
exactly the same proportion. This was well exemplified in the
rate wars of 1893. These percentages have been fixed after a
long process of compromise among conflicting interests. Another
point of special interest is that these rates are adjusted
on the basis strictly of the long and short haul principle,
namely, that all intermediate points enjoy a somewhat lower
rate than the terminal points, although the percentage may
not be exactly upon a mileage basis. Consideration of the
distribution of these percentages points to many apparent
inequalities in the adjustment; but, as a matter of fact, it will
be found that the existence of competing routes, of water
transportation or of other factors, offers a partial explanation
in most instances.</p>

</div>

<p>Such being the general character of this comprehensive
trunk line system, the relation of it to the tariffs described
heretofore is not difficult to demonstrate. Each separate
railway having developed a well-ordered rate schedule, they
have all met and agreed upon a unified scheme; which as far
as possible harmonizes all conflicting interests. The gradation
of rates rising with increasing distance from New York
on each separate road, is adjusted to the corresponding gradation
of rates of its neighbors on either side. The result is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
series of rate zones, lying more or less concentrically about
the terminal point. These zones are highly irregular in width
and area, but possess one feature in common. Each remoter
zone is one stage higher in rates than its predecessor. This
relationship is indicated by the cross section diagram herewith.
This cross section, of course, differs from the diagrams heretofore
shown. It is purely geographical, being taken, not along
one single railway but as the crow flies&mdash;straight across the
whole trunk line territory. But in order to appreciate the
significance of this elaborate scheme, one should imagine a
whole series of such progressively rising rates, radiating out along
the different lines of railway. Connecting the corresponding
levels or stages upon each one with those of its neighbors, the
concentric zones are immediately outlined. The advantage of
such a broad scheme is that it generalizes the single line tariff;
taking into view every place, no matter how small and irrespective
of its location whether upon a through line or merely
a local transverse one. Every town, no matter how insignificant,
is assigned a place in a logically evolved plan. Such
would seem to be the ideal of rate construction, toward which
all traffic managers should strive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing description of the development of a mileage
tariff is applicable to only a part of the traffic. A very large
volume of tonnage,&mdash;said to be not less than seventy-five per
cent. in America, sixty-three per cent. in Prussia and fifty per
cent. in the United Kingdom,&mdash;moves under special rates
made in quite another way in response to the exigencies of
commercial competition. The making of these freight rates in
practice is an extremely complicated matter. No single road
is independent of rates made by its rivals&mdash;rates applicable
not only to competing commodities and markets, but also as
affected by apparently the most remote and disconnected contingencies.
Thus railway rates, as has well been said, are not
a set of independent threads; they form a fabric. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
so interwoven everywhere that if one thread be shortened, it
will cause a kink in the fabric that may run almost anywhere.
In order to understand this it will be necessary to describe
somewhat in detail the nature of competition as applied to
transportation; and then to show by a few concrete illustrations,
the various factors which actively enter into the determination
of specific rates. Laymen and legislators do not
sufficiently appreciate the extremely delicate nature of the
work. Much discussion relative to railway competition seems
to be based upon the assumption that it consists in the main
of the competition of railway lines more or less parallel or
else operating under substantially like conditions. As a matter
of fact competition in transportation is to a large degree
far more complex.</p>

<p>Railway competition is of three entirely distinct sorts.
These may be denominated, respectively, competition of routes,
competition in facilities and competition of markets.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
first of these, competition of routes, as the name suggests, is
limited to the activities of the carriers alone. It occurs whenever
two railways are exposed to identical commercial conditions
both at the point of origin and of destination. The
rivalry is direct and physical. The only competition possible
is that concerning the route by which traffic may move between
those two points. Such competition is most likely to
arise between more or less parallel lines, as for instance between
the various trunk roads from New York to Chicago.
The classic instances in our history are of the rate wars due to
the West Shore and the Nickel Plate, which were built for the
express purpose of engendering competition with the then
existing lines,&mdash;the New York Central and the Lake Shore,
respectively. The same sort of simple competition prevails, of
course, between a railway and a parallel canal or other waterway,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>as, for instance, between the Erie canal and the trunk lines,
or the Illinois Central and the Mississippi river. Such simple
competition as this, where confined to railways alone, almost
inevitably leads to one of two results: the roads may remain
independent, preventing ruinous rate wars by pooling; or else,
as a result of long continued cut-throat competition, the bankrupt
road may be bought up and merged with the solvent one.
This was the fate of the old New York and New England railway,
finally purchased by the New Haven system; of the West
Shore and Nickel Plate lines; and of the Kansas Pacific, unloaded
on the Union Pacific by Jay Gould. The nature of
railway competition is indeed such that no other result than
consolidation or pooling can ensue. Weyl is right in his
observation that,&mdash;"Strictly speaking, permanent competition
can exist, not between railroads struggling for the same
traffic; but solely between those railroads which have no
territory in common."</p>

<p>This first form of competition of routes or, as it has been
called, of alternative routes, often obtains where conditions of
competition are more obscure than in these simple instances
above named. In the rivalry for the imported plate glass or
crockery traffic between the trunk lines and the Gulf roads,
the competition is none the less of routes between Liverpool
and Chicago, although the water carriage by way of New
Orleans or Galveston is so much more roundabout. Freight
actually moves from Boston to Chicago by a line 1786 miles
long, via Asheville, N. C., while the direct distance is only
1004 miles.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> From St. Louis to Meridian, Miss., is 512 miles
by direct rail line; yet traffic may move over 2000 miles going
to New York and then around.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The map on p. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>, showing
the various rail and water lines concerned in traffic between
New York and the little town of Troy, Ala., shows how widespread
are the ramifications of competition of this sort. Mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>fold
instances of such roundabout carriage have been elsewhere
described in full.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> They differ from the competition of parallel
routes, however, in the important regard that absorption of
the long lines by the short ones becomes both physically and
financially impossible. Whenever a large area like the Pacific
slope is devoid of manufactures, and wherever the source of
supplies is sufficiently concentrated, as, for instance, in the
manufacture of agricultural implements which are almost
exclusively made in or about Chicago, we still have to do with
a clear case of competition of routes, although a great number
of carriers may participate in the business. When molasses
or rice are only to be had from New Orleans, the centre of such
business, the carriers to all tributary consuming points compete
for the routing of it over their own respective lines. These
carriers may operate either by land or sea or by a combination
of both; and they may transport commodities by the most
roundabout ways.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The determinant feature, however, distinguishing
this class of competition is neither the mode or carriage
nor its length; but is found in the fact that the commercial
conditions at both ends of the line, points of origin and destination,
are identical for each participant in the business. Direct
competition of routes, therefore, has to do with pure transportation,&mdash;the
creation of place values,&mdash;and this being the case,
the relative cost of service is always a factor of moment.</p>

<p>Competition of facilities, the second of the three phases of
railway competition above mentioned, deals, as its name
implies, not at all with the rates charged but with the facilities
or conveniences afforded. Such competition is confined solely
to rivalry for business at the established rates. Immediately
on the appearance of any departure from these conditions the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>question becomes one of competition of either of the other two
sorts. An instance of competition of facilities would be the
introduction of reclining chairs or of a superior service in passenger
business. When the Rock Island system offered such
facilities without an extra charge, it became necessary at once
for others to meet this competition in the same way that they
would meet a reduction of rates. Any reduction in time of
transit for freight business between two given points without
extra charge, would in the same manner give rise to competition
of facilities. Such facilities, however, as might have a distinct
money value, as, for instance, free storage, cartage, demurrage
or milling-in-transit, any one of which practically amounts to
giving value without charge, are, of course, equivalent to a
reduction of the rate; and do not belong in this class of considerations
at all. Only those conveniences or facilities, which,
while attempting to secure business may not be compounded
for money, should be classified in this group. It should also be
observed that competition of facilities may as readily arise
between parts of the same railway system or under pooling
agreements to maintain rates, as between distinct and independent
companies.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> And such competition between parent
and child often arises. Thus, for instance, business was as
actively solicited as ever by the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore
&amp; Ohio in competition during the several years of financial
control of one by the other prior to 1907. The New Haven
railway may compete with its own water lines around Cape
Cod or on Long Island Sound. But in all of these instances the
cardinal feature to note is that the competition is always at the
established rate. For New England, although the New Haven
system and the Boston and Maine do not compete on rates
at their points of contact, there is constant rivalry in respect of
facilities or service. The same thing is undoubtedly true of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Atchison and the Southern Pacific in the carriage of California
fruits. Although operated under pooling agreements, yet they
were competitors in the matter of the service offered. Each
sought an enlarged volume of tonnage, but not by cutting the
agreed rate.</p>

<p>The third form of competition in transportation is dependent
upon the competition of markets; and is not in reality direct
competition between carriers at all. This is the most difficult
of all forms to understand.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It is certainly in many cases more
than a "euphemism for railway policy."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Yet although indirect
and often obscure, it is of fundamental and conclusive
importance in the determination of freight rates. Commercial
competition deals not with a mere choice of routes, but with
alternative markets. The carriers act, not independently and
of their own volition, but only as agents or representatives for
their constituents, the shippers. They may become tools or
weapons in the hands of merchants or manufacturers who are
the real contestants. It is largely in this sense that it is so
often alleged, and rightfully, that railway traffic managers
oftentimes do not <i>make</i> rates at all. Their energies are bent
to the analysis of those circumstances by which their rates are
made for them.</p>

<p>The production or preparation of commodities for final
consumption falls naturally into two distinct parts; the creation
of form value, succeeded by the conferring of place value.
Transportation is concerned alone with the latter process.
Of these two operations, the latter, the creation of place values,
is by far the more elastic and adaptable process. The grower,
the miner or the manufacturer has his first costs more or less
rigidly fixed by natural or human conditions; such as the fertility
of the soil, the grade of ore, the prevailing scale of wages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>and so on. His proximity to the status of a marginal producer
depends upon his relative position in these respects. With
the carrier, matters are more contingent. Including within
its reach, as it does, many grades of producers and consumers,
each more or less rigidly held bound by his own circumstances
and conditions, as above said, the carrier is able to exercise a
wide range of choice in fixing that margin of value created which
it reserves for itself. And at all times, by reason of the factors
set forth elsewhere, primarily its subjection to the law of increasing
returns, this intermediate share of the carrier tends to
adjust or accommodate itself to the end that it may discover or
produce a wider margin between values in the hands of producer
and consumer, respectively. This may be best accomplished
by a progressive widening of its field of activities, that is to say,
by an enlargement of its physical reach and scope. It is always
striving to lower the cost of production made by the marginal
producer. Its motto must ever be, to get more business, if
not right at home by search for it abroad&mdash;and this always
with the chance that the greater the distance between the producer
and the consumer, the greater the possible margin of
place value remaining as its individual share.</p>

<p>This ever-present incentive to widen the market carries
with it a direct consequence. A market is a commercial area
characterized by a prevalent equality of prices. Phenomenal
development in this respect is characteristic of the United
States. For many commodities the market is coextensive with
the national domain. It is the chosen function of transportation
agents, by rail and water, to ensure this result; to preserve
an equality of prices, despite the variety of producing and
consuming conditions. The railway is the agent by which the
market is thus widened and rivalries are thus equalized. In
railway parlance this is what is known as "keeping everyone in
business." The following quotation from the Senate Committee
Hearings of 1905 adequately describes the process: "I
am interested in the erection of a mill that has just been com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>pleted,
and sometime since I was figuring on the question of a
smokestack. I wanted to have that stack built out of brick
that is burned in New Jersey, and that is several hundred miles
away. It is a long way to ship freight from New Jersey to
North Carolina. A quotation was made me by the stack builder,
whose office is in New York, and I remarked to him, 'That
price is prohibitive; I cannot pay that price for that stack.'
He said, 'That is the best I can do; but if you will tell me what
you can afford to pay for that stack, in competition with home-burned
brick, I will see what I can do with the railway people.'
He said, 'All right; I will take it up with the railway people.'
His quotation included the delivery of the brick and the erection
of the stack at my plant. It would require something like
about fifty carloads of brick to build that stack. Within a
week he had his price revised, and gave me a satisfactory
quotation and took my contract for the stack. Of course he
had to get a special rate from the railway people, because there
is no regular tariff on brick from New Jersey to North Carolina."
In this instance the railways actually created this new business
by so adjusting the margin between the minimum cost of making
brick in New York and in North Carolina, as to make it possible
for the traffic to move. The special rate here mentioned,
however, should be carefully distinguished from a secret rebate
offered to one contractor as against another in the same place.
This commodity rate, while special to meet a particular contingency,
was open to any other shipper similarly circumstanced.
The student cannot too carefully discriminate between these
two sorts of special rates. They are constantly confused in the
public mind. The effect of these open commodity rates, is
not to create difference of opportunity between individuals,
but to generalize economic conditions and equalize prices
throughout wide areas.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory way to describe commercial competition
as applied to carriers is by concrete illustrations.
There are two distinct varieties or degrees of it, which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
be denominated primary and secondary. These might as
properly, perhaps, be called simple and complex, or direct and
indirect. Of these, the first concerns those cases wherein a
commodity undergoes no physical transformation between producer
and consumer. Shipments are usually direct. Only
one rate is involved. Shall St. Louis and the South, for example,
be supplied with salt from the Kansas or Michigan
fields?<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This is a case of pure transportation,&mdash;the creation
of place value, alone. The Aroostook farmers of Maine compete
in prices with the potato growers of Michigan in the New
York market. Each district is usually represented by a railway,
dependent upon the prosperity of its particular constituency.
Competition of markets is usually more keen where a
number of carriers are concerned, each representing its own
clients; but it may conceivably arise as between several markets
served by the same company, especially with the growth of
great railway systems. The Southern Pacific must insure a
rate from California on oranges to eastern markets, as compared
with the rates over the southern roads from Florida,
sufficiently low to warrant the venture of capital in the industry.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
Marble from the quarries of Vermont and North Carolina, and
paving blocks from the Lithonia district in Georgia and from
Wisconsin or South Dakota, must meet in Chicago on even
terms. Such competition, although simple and direct, recognizes
no national bounds. Copper from Montana must be
laid down in Liverpool at rates to permit of meeting the price
on Chili bars from South America. Our entire grain and cotton
crops must be transported at rates which will enable them to
hold their own in European markets. The California raisin has,
in this manner, had to make its way into Eastern markets in
the United States against the pressure of importations from
Spain, as described in another place.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The cotton mills in New
England and in the South must have their output carried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>China under conditions which will enable them to meet the
price made by the British manufacturer. This last instance,
however, introduces us to the second form of competition;
inasmuch as a double transportation is involved first from the
fields to the mill, and thereafter from the mill to the consumer.</p>

<p>Secondary or indirect forms of commercial competition in
transportation, concerning, as has been said, not one but two
distinct carriages of entirely different goods, needs to be
in turn subdivided still further. The products of agriculture
and mines afford the best instances. The lumber business is
peculiarly suggestive in this connection, owing to the fact
that in the United States a vast treeless area in the Middle
West is surrounded with forest tracts available for development.
The market again in this case is limited only by our
national frontier. Omaha is supplied with yellow pine and
cypress from Louisiana after a 1,200-mile haul; Oregon fir
brought 1,800 miles in each instance for fifty cents per hundred
pounds; and with Michigan hemlock and pine transported
less than 500 miles for eleven and a half cents. These various
sorts of lumber are all more or less competitive. And in each
case the final cost of laying down the product in Omaha is
determined; first, by the rate from the stump to the mill, and
then, as sawed lumber, thence on to destination. The Eau
Claire, Wisconsin, lumber case<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, fully describes the intricacies of adjustment
needed to hold a number of such producers on a parity. In
this instance Eau Claire, "next the stump," as an important
lumbering centre was shown to be declining in importance relatively
to Mississippi river towns, which received their logs by
raft down stream. A differential of a few cents was threatening
the welfare of a considerable population. The Wichita, Kansas,
cases are suggestive in a similar way.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Sugar is laid down at
this market from every point of the compass. From Hawaii
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>it is shipped in the raw state to San Francisco, and then brought
East, like the Oregon lumber, cheaply, as a back-load to counter-balance
westbound shipments of grain and manufactures.
From New Orleans refineries comes the Louisiana product, and
from the Atlantic sea ports the Cuban sugar; but in each case
the carriage is broken at an intermediate point, at which manufacture
or jobbing ensues. A large class of operations analogous
to this, known as "milling in transit" and "floating cotton,"
elsewhere described in detail, involve the same complexity
and interrelation of rates.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The point to carry forward is that
commercial competition demands that in every case not single
rates but the sums of all the connecting rates for each competing
person or region shall be properly adjusted. If this be not
done, some one will be excluded from the market and "put
out of business."</p>

<p>By this time in our ascending scale of complexities, it will
be observed that manufacture now begins to outweigh mere
transportation in importance. With low-grade products, like
salt or sugar, the increment of value due to transportation
is relatively high as compared with manufacturing costs. As
the grade of product rises, however, the differences in value
and in form between the raw and the finished product, render
the problem of location of the manufacture more difficult as
affected by the relative adjustment of rates of transportation
for the two. According to the data of the Federal Bureau
of Corporations, the cost of refining crude petroleum, worth
three to four cents a gallon at the wells in Pennsylvania,
should not exceed one-half cent a gallon. This sum would
barely pay for the first hundred miles of its carriage by rail,
as ordinarily shipped. The market is, of course, extraordinarily
extensive; hence the persistent flagrancy of the practices of
secret rebating by the Standard Oil Co.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> To obtain such
special favors in transportation outweighed in importance the
incentive to introduce economies in production. In this industry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>where little waste occurs in manufacture, the refineries
may well be located at the consumers' door. The manufacture
of furniture for the Pacific states, on the other hand, must be
located "next the stump," in North Carolina or New England.
The long carriage must be applied, not to the bulky lumber
but to the finished product. The freight rate on lumber from
Oregon to Pittsburg is just about equal to the value of the
logs at the mill. Obviously, the large proportion of waste or
common lumber will not bear a high addition to its cost by
carriage to any distance. In the manufacture of fur hats a
shrinkage of weight occurs of one-half between the fur scraps
and the finished product. In such a case it is imperative, either
that the factory be near the source of supply or that the rate
on the two distinct commodities be nicely adjusted. The
decision of the United States Steel Corporation to build a large
plant at Duluth for supplying the northwestern market is the
outcome of such considerations. The main point is that
the adjustment of a number of rates may determine, not only the
general welfare of the industry but even its specific geographical
location with reference to the raw material on the one side and
the market on the other.</p>

<p>The jobbing or wholesale business of the United States exemplifies
the most highly involved and complex details of commercial
competition.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> In this field it appears most clearly that,
as is so often alleged, railway traffic managers hold the welfare
of entire communities, as it were, in the palms of their hands.
In all the cases heretofore cited, great natural forces outweighed
the purely personal and human ones. Soil, climate and mineral
resources more or less completely determined the final outcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>of commercial competition. But the distributive business of a
country is more largely artificial. It is more subject to human
control, and may be influenced by personal considerations.
Shall the economically dependent southern planter be supplied
with manufactures of all sorts,&mdash;from harnesses to tin dippers&mdash;from
mid-western cities like Cincinnati and Chicago or
from eastern centres, such as New York and Baltimore? This
is the underlying economic issue raised in the notable Cincinnati
Freight Bureau Case in 1894; in the course of whose
determination the Supreme Court of the United States raised
the more immediate and pressing question of the authority of
the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate rates at all.
In the dust raised by the controversy over this purely legal
question, the basic economic dispute was lost to view.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Shall
the people of the Pacific slope be supplied with hardware and
analogous products from their own large cities which buy at
wholesale from the East, break bulk at San Francisco or Seattle
and ship out to smaller towns in less than carload lots; or shall
the distribution take place at the hands of jobbing houses located
several thousand miles away at Chicago or St. Louis? This is
the economic dispute raised in the St. Louis Business Men's
League case.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The very existence of San Francisco as a commercial
centre may depend upon it. For the primary and
secondary operations of commerce are often complementary.
At the large cities, concentration of raw staples moving inward
naturally entails back loads outward at low rates for manufactured
goods distributed by jobbers. Or, taking the smaller
places, the farmer will of necessity buy his cotton cloth, sugar
and coal in the town to which he drives by wagon to deliver his
cotton, corn or wheat.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The entire puzzling class of cases dealing with the southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>basing point system are primarily concerned with such issues
as these.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Three distinct classes of cases arise. There is, first,
the competition between cities of equal size, be they large or
small, such as Memphis, Tenn., and Little Rock, Ark.; Danville,
Va., and Lynchburg; or Cleveland, and Cincinnati, Ohio: secondly,
the rivalries between large cities and what may be called
secondary local centres in the same part of the country,&mdash;such
as Seattle, Wash., <i>v.</i> Spokane; Chicago <i>v.</i> Burlington or
Dubuque, Iowa; or Atlanta, Ga., <i>v.</i> Macon: and thirdly,
the intense rivalries between the great first-class cities, like
New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and the rest of the field,
big and little.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The mail order houses, the express business
and the parcels post intervene at this point. But in all of
these issues, series of no less than three separate transportation
costs have to be totalized and kept more or less on a parity.
The intricacy is increased by reason of the fact that shipments
must be made, first at wholesale to the jobbers, and thereafter
usually in less-than-carload lots to retailers. If the carload
rate be relatively too low, with reference to the rate on small
lots, the jobbers near the market will be upbuilt and the jobbers
at a distance cannot compete. If the opposite relation obtains,
the jobber in a distant great city will be able to ship out small
orders cheaper than the local dealer can obtain them by carload
and, breaking bulk, peddle them from his own town. So narrow
is the margin of profit on staple goods that a difference of a
fraction of a cent per pound may exclude a dealer from the field
entirely. This question of carload ratings is, however, treated
elsewhere; impinging, as it does upon matters of freight classifications.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The rivalries of jobbers and middlemen in different cities
are inevitably borne into the offices of traffic managers. Were
all railways equally interested in all cities alike, the matter
need not go further, engendering railway rivalries. But such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>is seldom the case. Hardly a road can be named, whose interests
are not more or less identified with some particular
city. Commercial rivalry thus at once leads to railway competition.
Four or five railways, like the Chicago and Northwestern,
radiate out to the west from Chicago, and have no
interest in St. Louis. Almost as many, like the Missouri
Pacific, go out from St. Louis without entering Chicago.
Others, like the old Union Pacific and, formerly, the Atchison
system, only come to the Missouri river, and consequently
wish to upbuild their eastern termini, Omaha or Kansas City.
Only a few, like the Illinois Central, reach them all. Such a
road is usually called upon to act as a mediator in all disputes.
"It is a continual struggle between the line from
Kansas City to St. Louis with no interest in Chicago, and
the line from Kansas City to Chicago with no interest in St.
Louis," as one witness before the Industrial Commission
phrases it. Compromise is the only outcome. And in this
manner an involved structure of differentials is built up, oftentimes
top heavy and always susceptible of collapse on the
defection of any party to the agreement. When a truce was
patched up between the trunk lines and the Gulf roads after
the sugar rate war of 1905, it is said to have taken twenty
experts three entire days merely to "line up" rates on a parity
between the competing jobbing centres.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="700" height="362" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The simplest compromise in any dispute over rates between
competing centres is the concession of absolute equality or,
as it is called, of flat rates between all points irrespective of
distance. This shifts the burden from the carriers and places
competition entirely upon the shoulders of the merchants.
Oddly enough, also, this result of equal rates regardless of
distance between various competing centres, especially when
they are secondary distributing or concentrating points rather
than original sources of traffic, may sometimes evolve naturally
out of commercial conditions imposed by tariffs built up upon
the basis of distance. The accompanying theoretical diagram,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
based upon actual traffic conditions prevalent in Missouri river
territory, serves to illustrate the way in which, under certain
circumstances, such equalization of rates may take place.
Two groups of cities are here represented as though lying respectively
along two river valleys north of their separation at a
point G. Let us call them the Mississippi and the Missouri
for purposes of identification. The starting point is equality
of rates from such a distant point as New York (O) to all places
along the Mississippi from A to G. Such equality properly
arises in theory from the substantially equal distance from New
York. In practice also, under the trunk line rate system,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
such equality prevails, inasmuch as the rates from New York
to such a series of Mississippi river crossings is fixed at 125 per
cent. of the rate from New York to Chicago. By a similar
course of reasoning, namely, the approximately equal distance
from New York (O), rates from that place to a second series of
points along the Missouri river should be and are in effect made
equal. From these two facts it logically follows that the
balances of the rates from all points on the Mississippi river out
along an extension of their lines from New York toward the
west should also be equal. This is obviously in conformity
with the mathematical principle that equals subtracted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>equals leave equal balances. Thus the rates B X, D Y and
F Z are compelled to equality. From this relationship in turn
follows still another. All rates from any point on the inner
series of towns to any point whatsoever on the outer western
series of places along the Missouri river must remain equal
regardless of distance. For each line from New York to A,
B, C, D, etc., wishes, of course, to participate in business not
only on the direct extension of its own line, but to as many
other points as possible.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Without some agreement, however,
it would normally enjoy traffic only on the direct extension of
its own line. The point Y would most naturally be reached
by way of C, D or E, over the shortest routes. Competitors
on either side would similarly enjoy an advantage in more
direct lines from New York to the places immediately beyond
them. Thus for business from New York to Z, the more
direct lines through E, F or G would obviously have an
advantage over lines which passed around through A, B, C
or D. An almost irresistible incentive to cut-throat competition
would exist. The only way the lines east of the
inner circle can peaceably partition business to the outermost
western points is by an agreement to make all rates between
the inner and outer circles the same. In this manner the
rates from A to Z or from G to X are reduced to an equality
with the rates offered by the shortest route between the two
rivers, which, in this case, is E Z. The rate for this shortest
line then becomes the basic one, upon which all the others
depend.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>Traffic Conditions in Missouri River Territory</p></div>
</div>

<p>The foregoing economic reasoning underlies the actual tariff
system prevailing in what is known as Missouri river territory.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Two great streams separating at St. Louis form the
eastern and western boundaries of Missouri and Iowa. All
along the two edges of these states are located important river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>cities, each of which has more or less direct communication
with every other crossing on the other river, over a complicated
system of interlaced lines. There are no physical barriers,
the country being plain and open. The starting point and
basis of the whole scheme is the shortest direct distance between
the two nearest points, namely Hannibal on the Mississippi,
and St. Joseph and Kansas City on the Missouri.
The situation is shown by the map herewith. At these points
the two rivers are approximately two hundred miles apart.
For this distance the base rate of sixty cents per hundred pounds,
first class, is fixed by common agreement. Were local business
only to be considered, and were the railways not competing,
the rate between other points on the two rivers at greater distances
apart, such as for instance, Burlington on the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and Omaha on the Missouri, might be determined on a relative
distance basis, as in trunk line territory. But the commercial
fact is that a large proportion of the business between all these
points consists of long-distance traffic from the eastern seaboard
which may cross the Mississippi at any one of these
gateways between Dubuque and St. Louis on its way to the
cities on the Missouri river. All of these through long-distance
shipments must, of course, enjoy the same competitive rate to
the ultimate western destination on the Missouri river. And,
inasmuch as the rate from the east to the Mississippi crossings
is everywhere the same, namely 125 per cent. of the New York-Chicago
rate, it follows that the balance of the rate from these
points on to the Missouri river across Iowa and Missouri,
irrespective of distance, must likewise be the same. In other
words, the rates between all these Mississippi and Missouri
river points must be equalized, irrespective of the length of the
intervening route, whether it be two hundred miles by the
shortest direct line from Hannibal to Kansas City across Missouri,
three hundred and fifty miles from Burlington to Omaha
across Iowa, or even seven hundred miles by the roundabout
line of the Illinois Central skirting both states. In brief,
every railway which touches both rivers, however circuitous
its route, is compelled to quote the same rate from every point
on the Mississippi river to every other point on the Missouri.
This rate must be the one fixed, as already described, for the
shortest direct line, namely sixty cents per hundred pounds
first class. Furthermore, in precisely the same way that these
rates to Missouri river points from the eastern seaboard are
built up and equalized, the rates from Chicago to the same
Missouri river points must be kept even. The rate through
from any one of the long chain of Mississippi gateways must
be the same irrespective of distance. This figure, by common
agreement, has for many years been twenty cents per hundred
pounds higher than the rate across Illinois to the Mississippi
river gateways from Chicago alone. The dominant note of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
this whole tariff is equalization of rates between all points in
competition with one another over all possible routes. Freight
thus moves freely in every direction and all markets are held
on an absolute parity.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It is one of the most remarkable
features of American commercial organization, this practical
elimination of the element of distance from interstate trade
over wide areas.</p>

<p>The possible evil lurking in too widespread an acceptance
of the principle of the flat rate is clearly apparent in the reasoning
of the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, lumber case.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This town
complained of the disability under which it labored in shipping
lumber to Missouri river points by comparison with other
places round about. It appeared in the evidence that as
early as 1884, under arbitration, all the rates from competing
centres had been adjusted on the basis of differentials; and
that, as interpreted by the carriers, the purpose of these differentials
was to even up the differences between competing
towns; to the end that all manufacturers should be put upon
an equality in the consuming territory. But this necessarily
involved the practice of penalizing or nullifying in a way the
advantages of location. "If Eau Claire could produce lumber
cheaper than Winona or La Crosse, then the latter points were
to have a lower rate in order to enable them to compete."
This practice the Interstate Commerce Commission condemned
at that time; and it has consistently adhered to the precedent
then laid down. Obviously, any other general course of action
would be analogous to hobbling the fleetest horse in a race to
bring him down to the rate of progress of the slowest laggard.
The principle of the handicap applied within moderate limits
makes for an exciting athletic contest; but if it be overdone, it
eliminates all interest from the contest whatever. The race
becomes one, not of skill or endurance in running, but of
securing a sufficiently liberal handicap. Competition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>be of advantage in the way of progress must always have
in view the survival of the fittest and the elimination of the
unfit.</p>

<p>The vast extent of the United States, the necessity of transporting
commodities great distances at low cost and the progressiveness
of railway managers, has led to an extraordinary
development of the phase of rate making above-mentioned.
The principle of the flat rate, based upon the theory that
distance is a quite subordinate, if not indeed entirely negligible,
element in the construction of freight tariffs under circumstances
of competition, was fully accepted twenty-five
years ago.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> J. C. Stubbs, traffic manager of the Harriman
lines, speaking of transcontinental business in 1898, clearly
expressed it as "the traditional policy of the American lines as
between themselves to recognize and to practise equality of
rates as the only reasonable and just rule ... regardless of the
characteristics of their respective lines, whether equal in length
or widely different." It is the theory upon which the southern
basing-point system is founded; and it is the common practice
in making rates into and out of New England&mdash;being in fact
vital to the continued prosperity of this out-of-the-way territory.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
President Tuttle, of the Boston &amp; Maine, has most
ably supported this principle of equality of rates irrespective
of distance. "It is the duty of transportation agents," he
says, "to so adjust their freight tariffs that, regardless of
distance, producers and consumers in every part of this country
shall, to the fullest extent possible, have equal access to the
markets of all parts of this country and of the world, a result
wholly impossible of attainment if freight rates must be constructed
upon the scientific principle of tons and miles." This
is the principle of the blanket rate attacked in the famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>Milk Producers' Protective Association case in 1897;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and it
is the practice which has been so fully discussed of late, as
generally applied to lumber rates from the various forest regions
of the United States into the treeless tract of the Middle West.
The principle, while applied thus generally in the construction
of tariffs, is of far greater applicability in the making of special
or commodity rates. Wool rates afford one of the best examples.
Under such rates the bulk of the tonnage of American
railways is at present moved. The essential principle of such
special rates, constituting exceptions to the classified tariffs,
is that of the flat rate; namely, a rate fixed in accordance with
what the traffic will bear, without regard to the element of
cost, that is to say, of distance. But a noticeable trend away
from the flat rate is evident in recent decisions of the Interstate
Commerce Commission; especially in the Intermountain case,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The intricacy of freight rate adjustment in response to
the subtleties of commercial competition depends only in small
measure upon the absolute freight rate imposed. The main
problem is really that of relativity. But this does not mean
mere relativity as between directly competing commodities
or places. A strict relativity based upon commercial conditions
must often obtain as well between the rates on raw materials
and their own finished products; between all the various
by-products in an industry; and, of course, always as between
goods capable of substitution one for another. A few illustrations
will serve to make these details clear.</p>

<p>The matter of properly correlating the freight rate on raw
materials and the finished products made from them, is more
far-reaching than it seems. The location and development
of manufacturing depends upon it. The country may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>broadly divided into agricultural and manufacturing sections.
The first of these is ambitious to develop its resources; not
only to feed, but to clothe itself and make other provision for
its needs. No sooner does it seek to develop local manufacturing
than it finds itself exposed to competition from the older
established manufacturers at a distance. Sometimes, even,
these remote manufacturers draw their supplies of raw material
from its own fields and forests. These supplies are then shipped
long distances as raw material; manufactured and thereafter
returned to sell in competition with the local product. The
local market in relatively undeveloped areas is probably insufficient
to provide support for manufactures on a profitable
scale. It is essential to dispose of the surplus product over a
wider area. Thus there arise two classes of manufacturers:
one "next the stump," manufacturing at the source of the raw
material and desiring to ship the finished product; the other,
remote perhaps from supplies of raw material, but favored by
long experience, by abundant supplies of capital and of skilled
labor and by other advantages.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Neither class of shippers
can prosper without overflowing into the domain of the other.
The outcome of this competition depends in part upon the policy
of the carriers. If the rate on the raw material be relatively
low, the remote manufacturer is aided. Cotton mills and shoe
factories in New England prosper in competition with establishments
in the South or the Middle West. If, on the other hand,
the rate on raw materials be inordinately high, while at the
same time low on outward-bound shipment of manufactures
from the seat of the raw materials, the tendency is in favor of
the upbuilding of manufactures, not near the historic centres
of population and consumption, but near the sources of natural
wealth, which are the potential homes of manufacturing.</p>

<p>The long-standing controversy over relative rates on wheat
and flour for export affords an interesting illustration of the difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of properly correlating charges of this sort.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Originally
the rates on wheat and flour&mdash;the raw material and the manufactured
product&mdash;were the same. In 1890 the railways
leading to the Gulf ports began to discriminate by giving lower
rates on wheat, but the trunk lines until 1899 held to the original
equality between the two. Finally, however, the struggle
between the trunk lines and the Gulf roads for business forced
the former to lower their rates on wheat, leaving the flour rates&mdash;not
subject to Gulf competition&mdash;undisturbed. At times
the rate on wheat for export was as much as nine cents per
hundred pounds lower than the rate on flour. Thus the rate
on wheat for export from the Mississippi river to the seaboard
was frequently twelve cents, while the rate on wheat from the
same points to Chicago added to the rate on flour there manufactured
and sent on in barrels or bags to New York, was
twenty-two cents&mdash;a clear discrimination against the domestic
manufacturer in this instance of ten cents per hundred pounds.
For his American-made flour, sent abroad in competition with
flour made in Liverpool from American wheat, would evidently
cost that much more at delivery. In other words, wheat could
be transported to England and there ground much cheaper
than it could be ground here and then shipped. This bore
with particular severity upon small millers, partly because
their costs of manufacture were relatively high, and also because
any limitation of export business forced the large millers to
bid more keenly for local domestic trade. Inasmuch as a
fair margin of profit to the American manufacturer would
not exceed two cents per hundredweight, it is apparent that
this discrimination operated severely against the American
miller. Minneapolis fortunately was unaffected by this discrimination,
much of its exports going out by Canadian lines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>to the Lakes. The carriers defended this difference in rates
on the ground of water competition by the Lakes or combined
rail and water routes, which were alone open to wheat, and
which thereby unduly lowered the rate on that commodity;
and also on the basis of the lower cost of service in moving the
raw material as compared with the finished product. It is
apparent that issue was really raised in such a case between
the interests of the farmer and of the manufacturer. The
United States, producing a surplus of wheat the price of which
is made on the Liverpool market in competition with the world,
is compelled to find an outlet for this product. It is obvious
that any reduction of the freight rate&mdash;the prices in Liverpool
remaining fixed&mdash;would inure to the benefit of the farmer, who
would thereby receive a higher price for his product. Viewed in
this way the railways by discriminating in favor of the rate
on wheat were helping the farmers. But, at the same time,
by moving this wheat more cheaply than flour the railways
were encouraging the location of flour milling abroad and
rendering it impossible to manufacture flour for export at
a profit in the cities of the Middle West. In these export
cases it does not appear clearly why the rate on flour for export
might not have been reduced somewhat. The Interstate
Commerce Commission finally rendered a decision to
the effect that the existing difference in rates constituted an
undue preference in favor of the foreign manufacturer, adding
at the same time that these discriminations seemed to be due
primarily not to a desire of the railways to aid the American
farmer in disposing of this surplus wheat, but to the bitterness
of competition between the Gulf and trunk line railways.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
They decided that any discrimination greater than two
cents per hundred pounds in favor of wheat for export as
against flour was unreasonable. This difference was permitted,
however, on account of the greater cost of handling the manufactured
product. It is significant of the then state of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>law that the railways paid no attention to this order, and,
although conditions improved somewhat, there is still great
complaint.</p>

<p>The relative rates on wheat and flour, even when for domestic
consumption, illustrate the same difficulty of commercial
competition&mdash;the necessity of adjusting the rate on raw materials
to that on the finished product.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The rate on wheat
from Wichita, Kan., for example, to California is fifty-five cents
per hundred pounds, while the rate on flour between the same
points is sixty-five cents. Is this difference in rates economically
justifiable? California wheat is soft, so that flour produced
from it is much improved by the admixture of hard wheat,
such as may be obtained in Kansas. California, formerly a
large wheat exporting state, has of late years relied to a considerable
degree upon the Middle West for part of its supplies.
Kansas flour sells for seventy-five cents a barrel more than California
wheat flour. Shall this Kansas wheat, to be consumed
in California, be ground in Wichita or in California? Here
is material for controversy, not between one particular railway
and another, but in reality between the millers in Kansas
and the millers in California. It is quite analogous to the
issue raised over export wheat and flour between the miller
in Chicago and his rival in Liverpool. In this instance, if
milled in Kansas, the railways enjoy the carriage of flour;
while, if ground in California, the railways carry the commodity
in the form of wheat. Owing to certain practical conditions,
such as the percentage of waste and relative differences in labor
costs, the Kansas miller appears to enjoy a certain advantage
over his far western competitors. At this point the interest of
particular railway companies appears. The Rock Island, if
the milling industry in Kansas develops, obtains the haul
not only of the flour but also of the fuel and of supplies
for the communities engaged in the business. On the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>hand the Southern Pacific is more largely interested in the
local development of manufactures in California. The Rock
Island by maintaining a lower rate on flour than on wheat,
would tend to hold its clients in the field. The Southern
Pacific, on the other hand, by securing the reduced rate on
the wheat from Kansas would materially advance the welfare
of its constituents. Thus the rivalries of the competing
localities immediately become the direct and immediate concern
of rival railways.</p>

<p>Cases precisely analogous in principle to those concerning
the relativity of rates on grain and grain products have troubled
the carriers for years in respect to the rates upon cattle and
packing house products.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A low rate on cattle as compared with
beef favors Chicago today as against Missouri river points,
the latter being nearer the cattle ranges; just as a generation
ago it enabled cattle to be brought to New York and Boston
to be there slaughtered and sold on the spot. The history
of this controversy throws much light upon the difficulties of
rate making in practice. Originally the railways encouraged
cattle raising by a rate which was only about one-third of the rate
charged for beef. Slaughtering was carried on in the East
adjacent to the great markets. To this policy the western
packers objected strenuously. They demanded a relatively
low rate on their finished product in order to enable them to
bid against the local eastern slaughter houses. The stockmen,
on the other hand, naturally desired a continuance of the low
rate on cattle, as it perpetuated competition between eastern
and western buyers. The controversy between the stock
raisers and the packers was thus shifted onto the shoulders of
the traffic managers of the railways. The dispute culminated
in 1883 when the Trunk Line Association appointed a special
committee to consider what the proper adjustment should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>This committee in turn referred the matter to Commissioner
Albert Fink, "Seeking a relativity of rates so as to make the
charges for transportation, including the expenses incident to
the transportation of dressed beef, the same per pound as the
charges per pound of dressed beef transported to the East in
the shape of live stock." A difficult task this, considering the
variety of by-products emerging into value year by year.
Cattle rates had been for some time fifty-two per cent., and then
later sixty per cent. of the dressed beef rates. This was relatively
higher for cattle than had been charged during the
seventies. But the western packers demanded that the relativity
in favor of the finished product be still further advanced
until cattle rates should equal seventy-five per cent. of the rates
on beef. This would effectually discourage the shipment of
cattle to eastern centres, and would tend to upbuild Kansas
City and Chicago at their expense. In 1884, the matter being
still in dispute, was referred to Hon. T. M. Cooley, afterward
chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission. He decided
that a fair compromise would be forty cents on cattle from
Chicago to New York with coincident rates of seventy cents on
beef. This would make the cattle rate about fifty-seven per
cent. of the beef rate. It was a victory for the stockmen as
against the western packers, who at once raised a great outcry.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to predict the final outcome had
not an entirely new factor appeared, which transformed the
conduct of the beef packing industry.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Specially constructed
stock cars owned by private companies began to be built.
These favored the perpetuation of competition between eastern
and western packers. To checkmate this, the western
packers had already embarked in 1879 upon the ownership of
privately owned refrigerator cars for the carriage of their
finished products. The custom was adopted by the railways
of paying for the use of these cars by making an allowance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>so much a mile as a deduction from the established tariffs.
This at once opened the way to secret rebates of all sorts.
The refrigerator traffic in these private cars was large in volume,
very regular and highly concentrated as to source. A
large tonnage could be diverted at any time to that road which
could best show its appreciation of the favor. The Grand
Trunk, for instance, in 1887 swept the board, monopolizing
this entire business for a brief time, obtaining it by secret and
discriminating rates. The railways, jointly, sought to free
themselves from the domination of the large packers; but the
phenomenal growth of their business, both domestic and export,
rendered them too powerful to resist. According to
expert data, during nine months to May 1, 1889, three shippers
alone received from one line of road $72,945 for the use
of their cars. This about equalled the initial cost of eighty
new cars. For the fiscal year 1895, $8,744,000 was paid by
the railways of the United States for the use of these cars&mdash;about
$4,000,000 of this being in the form of rental. At this
rate, profits of from twenty-five to fifty per cent. upon the investment
accrued to the great packers. These virtual rebates,
of course, drove all competitors from the field. The story of
the gradual extension of this system of private cars to include
fruit and produce business belongs in another place. Suffice
it to say that the bondage was broken only by the passage of
the Hepburn Act of 1906. The growth of these private refrigerator
car lines caused the disappearance of live stock shipments.
Packing and slaughtering on a large scale at the seaboard, either
for domestic consumption or export, was doomed. Meantime,
however, the controversy over the relative rates on beef
and cattle continued just as if anything really depended upon
it. The issue was again submitted to the commissioner of
the Trunk Line Association in 1887. In the following year a
select committee of the United States Senate was appointed at
the urgent request of the cattle raisers. Testimony before
this committee showed in detail how eastern packers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
striving to build up establishments near the points of consumption,
but were driven out of the business by the relatively
high costs of shipping cattle, as compared with the rates at
which dressed beef could be actually delivered from Chicago
and Missouri river points. This entire history, aside from
its significance as a study of personal discrimination, illustrates
the effect of a relatively increasing differential rate, partly
open and partly secret, against the raw material of an industry
as compared with the finished product. The result, at all
events, has been to concentrate the packing industry in the
Middle West. Nor is the controversy closed even yet.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> But
this time it is a question, not between the seaboard and Chicago,
but between Chicago and Missouri river points, or those
still nearer the southwestern ranges. Fort Worth and Oklahoma
City now become complainants against the Missouri
river points.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Always and everywhere the manufacture seeks
to develop at or near the source of the raw material. Whenever
this tendency does not appear in an industry it is pertinent to
inquire how far the relative adjustment of rates is responsible
for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Complexities in rate adjustment often arise from the fact
that in the manufacture of many commodities the marketing
of by-products is of increasing importance. The rate on the
whole series of related commodities must be taken into account
at once. Thus in lumbering, a large amount of waste or very
low-grade lumber is necessarily produced. This common lumber
cannot bear long transportation; it must be utilized locally,
if at all. On the other hand, the choicest specialties will command
a price even in remote markets. A monopoly price
is enjoyed in such a case. The Pacific coast lumbermen can
market their long timbers anywhere in the United States;
but the demand for the common lumber, restricted to a sparsely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>populated region, tends to be exceeded by the supply.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The
real competition between the southern, the Michigan, the
Wisconsin and the Pacific coast manufacturers thus narrows
down to the sale of the medium-grade product. And the cost
of production of this is, of course, in part dependent upon the
profit made upon the other two sorts, each of which in its
own field appears to be a monopoly. A wide market and a
good price for medium-grade lumber may so lessen the cost
of the cheapest by-products that they in turn may be so reduced
in price as to widen their reach to the consumer. Each
rate reacts upon the others. The situation can be successfully
controlled only by adjusting them all at once.</p>

<p>Not only are rates competitive as between raw materials
and the finished product made from them, but the circle of
competition immediately widens to include all commodities
capable of substitution one for another.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Coal rates, of course,
are partly determined by rates on cordwood, and <i>vice versa</i>.
During the great coal strike in Pennsylvania in 1903, soft coal
rates and hard coal rates were sadly disturbed. Such substitutions
are always likely to occur. But the conditions are
not always so simple as this. An instance in point is given
by a witness before the Senate (Elkins) Committee on Interstate
Commerce in 1905.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This shows how a reduction in the
rate for transportation of corn from Kansas to Texas brought
about a corresponding reduction in the rate on flour from
Minneapolis to Chicago. There was a large crop of corn in
Kansas; and the Chicago lines anticipated brisk business in
the carriage of this product. The traffic managers of lines
from Kansas to Texas, however, discovered a large demand
for corn in Texas at a price higher than then prevailed in
Kansas. Any rate less than the difference in prices between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>the two districts would cause shipments of corn to flow from
Kansas to Texas, just as inevitably as water flows down hill.
This rate would needs be low; but the corn could be loaded on
empty southbound cars which had been used to haul cotton
out of Texas to the north. This, of course, entailed a diversion
of corn from the Chicago railways, which promptly reduced
rates in order to hold their traffic. For years the rates upon
wheat and corn had been fixed in a definite relation to one
another, based upon commercial experience. Any reduction
of the corn rate compelled a reduction of the wheat rate. A
fall in the wheat rate brought about a drop in the rate on
flour. These reductions in corn started in southern Kansas;
but parallel lines in northern Kansas were compelled to follow
suit. Grain in the territory between the two roads could be
hauled by wagon either north or south corresponding to a fraction
of a cent per bushel difference in the price. Thus the reduction
in rates spread from one line to another all over Kansas,
throughout Nebraska up into Dakota and finally to Minnesota.
It not only affected the corn rate everywhere but it caused
a reduction in the rate on flour from Minneapolis to Chicago.
The reliance of Texas for a portion of its corn supply upon
the surplus product of Kansas sometimes leads to odd results.
This commodity is sometimes shipped as corn meal and sometimes
transported as corn to be afterwards ground in Texas.
The Texas millers at one time demanded a relative reduction
of the rate on grain as compared with corn meal, and the railway
commission of that state upheld them in that demand.
For ten years down to 1905 the differential in favor of the raw
product had been three cents a hundred pounds. Then the
railways, in connection with a general advance of rates, increased
the charge on corn meal until it amounted to about
nine cents per hundred pounds more than the rate on corn.
One cent a hundred pounds being a good profit in grinding
corn meal, this change shut the Kansas millers out of Texas
business. Application was made to the Interstate Commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Commission for relief. It then appeared on investigation that
the carriers had made use of the Texas millers in order to
prevent a general reduction of <i>both</i> grain rates and rates on
grain products. The Texas millers on general principles had
favored both these reductions. What happened is best described
in the evidence before the Senate Committee on Interstate
Commerce of 1905. "The railways went to the millers
of Texas and they said to them, 'Is there anything you want
here?' 'Why,' said the [Texan] millers, 'yes; we would like to
have that differential between corn and corn meal increased; we
think you ought to put the rate on corn meal up.' The railway
said, 'All right; you just stay away from that meeting down
at Austin so that there will not be any excuse for the Texas
commission, and if it undertakes to reduce these rates we will
raise this differential; we will raise the rate on corn meal to
the rate on flour.' The millers kept away from Austin&mdash;they
kept their part of the bargain&mdash;and they stayed away,
and the Texas commission was left without any support for
their proposition to reduce the corn rates, and the railway kept
their part of the bargain and lifted up the rate on corn meal so
that the differential was from nine to seven and one-half cents,
and that put the Kansas mills out of business."</p>

<p>Apparently insignificant details often determine the outcome
of commercial competition. Thus in the milling business,
where the margin of profit in the manufacture of flour may
not be over three cents per barrel, an infinitesimal change in the
freight rate may mean success or failure to long-established
industries. And the conditions vary indefinitely. Thus, as
between flour milling in Duluth and Buffalo, Duluth can buy
its wheat from the farmer direct during the entire winter, but
must ship its product mainly during the period of open water
navigation on the lakes. The reverse is true with the Buffalo
miller who can ship out his flour during the entire season, but
who must accumulate his whole stock of wheat before navigation
closes. And then Minneapolis as a milling centre has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to be taken into account. Eighty per cent. of the spring wheat
grown in the United States is in territory from which the freight
rates to Minneapolis and Duluth are the same. But the basic
rate to the East and Europe, fixing the all-rail rates, is the
combined lake and rail. By this route Duluth is one hundred
and fifty miles nearer the market than is Minneapolis, and
consequently enjoys a lower rate on its flour shipped out. A
three-cornered competitive problem exists, in which any change
at one point entirely upsets the commercial equilibrium.</p>

<p>The obligation on the part of a railway to protect its constituency,
not only in respect of particular rates, but in general
conditions as well, introduces still further complications. The
freight business of New England, for example, consists, first,
of the carriage of raw materials and supplies inwards; and,
secondly, thereafter of the transportation of the finished product
out to the consuming markets. Narrowly considered, it
may seem expedient to crowd the rate on coal as high as the
value of service probably will permit; but viewed in a large
way, it may prove to be a far better business policy to maintain
the rate on coal, cotton, and other staple supplies so low, that
the growth of population and production may in the long run
yield far greater returns on the high-grade manufactures which
the territory produces. Turning to the southern field, where
the economic conditions are reversed, it may be the better
policy to hold down the rate on raw cotton in order thereby
to stimulate this great basic industry and thereby enhance the
demand for the merchandise and foodstuffs which depend upon
general prosperity. A free hand afforded for the suitable adjustment
of such apparently independent services may contribute
far more to the general welfare than an insistence upon a petty
and near-sighted policy of extorting from each individual service
all the rate it can possibly endure. American railway managers
are gradually but surely coming to take a more liberal view
of these great possibilities and to consider the economic development
of their territories, not narrowly, but in a generous way.</p>

<p>Not only must rates of all sorts be delicately adjusted to
suit the immediate exigencies of trade; they must be constantly
modified in order to keep pace with its ever changing
conditions. This is peculiarly true of a rapidly growing country
like the United States. An admirable instance is afforded
by the complaint of the Lincoln Commercial Club before the
Interstate Commerce Commission.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Lincoln, Nebraska, lies
about fifty-five miles southwest of Omaha. Originally all its
supplies came from the East, as both cities were for a time
outposts of civilization. The coal supply came from Iowa and
Illinois, and the salt from Michigan. On these and most other
commodities the rates to Lincoln were made up of a through
rate from the East to the Missouri river, plus the local rate on
to destination. The city of Lincoln thus paid considerably
more than Omaha for all of its supplies. Gradually conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>have changed; until in 1907 it appeared that over half the soft
coal consumed in Lincoln was brought from Kansas and Missouri;
four-fifths of the lumber from the South and nearly all
the rest from the Pacific coast; glass and salt from the gas
belt and salt beds of Kansas; and a great deal of beet sugar
from the western fields. For a large proportion of these and
other supplies, Lincoln was actually as near or nearer the point
of production than Omaha, and yet the difficulties of effecting
an adjustment between rival carriers had prevented any modification
of rates corresponding to these changes in economic
conditions. On every one of these commodities the rate to
Lincoln remained steadily higher than to Omaha, regardless of
the source of supply. Unanimous consent was necessary for readjustment.
So long as any single road refused assent, a general
rate disturbance might be precipitated by any independent
action. The beneficent effect of the exercise of governmental
authority, powerful enough over all interested parties to compel
acquiescence, has been clearly apparent in affording relief.</p>

<p>A similar instance in the state of Wisconsin is afforded
by the compulsory readjustment of the freight rate on wood
pulp, lumber and sawed logs.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> On investigation it appeared
that, despite a very much lower commercial value for the raw
material used in paper manufacture, the rates on pulp wood
were more than double those on logs to be sawed up for lumber.
It appeared, furthermore, that this apparent anomaly was due
not so much to high rates on the pulp wood as to very low rates
on sawed logs. These latter rates for many years had been fixed
at a very low figure because originally the bulk of such logs,
cut in the river bottoms, was floated down stream to mills
along the Mississippi river. Competition with lumber raft
rates originally determined the charges on lumber by rail.
The paper industry did not begin until these conditions of
water competition had quite disappeared. Gradually, with
the progress of deforestation, all the timber is now found on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>uplands far from navigable water courses; so that the rates
today are not at all influenced by competitive rates on the
lumber rafts down river. Nevertheless the old tariffs on lumber
remained in force despite the changed conditions, while
the new rates on pulp wood were fixed independently of any
rates by water. It was only after careful investigation that
the injustice to the paper manufacturers from the disparity in
charges appeared. Here again it was the rigidity and interlocked
complexity of adjustment which placed it in the power
of one road to block change of any sort.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The compulsory
exercise of governmental authority cut the Gordian knot with
the result that substantial justice now obtains.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>From the preceding statements it will be observed that
carriers have another important commercial function beside
that of equalizing industrial conditions.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> They also act in a
protective or insurance capacity to the merchant or manufacturer.
The policy of "keeping everyone in business" implies
not only variety but variability of conditions. Capital is
proverbially timid. It will not venture into a new and uncertain
enterprise unless either profits are immediate and high
or, if moderate, likely to endure. In any event some guarantee
of permanence is required. This guarantee the carrier is often
able to offer. It may assume the obligation of protecting its
clients; that is, of saving them harmless against the intrusion
or irruption of hurtful competition. It thus exercises in a
certain sense the function of an insurance company, but with
this important difference: that while it has the strongest interest
in protecting its established industries against ruinous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>competition from abroad, it may desire to share in some degree
in their development and prosperity by way of reward. In
this latter sense the relation of the carrier to its clients partakes
of a profit-sharing arrangement. One of the broadest
issues between American railways and the public at the present
time is precisely this: whether the carriers are to share in business
profits; or merely, in addition to furnishing transportation,
are to collect a fixed fee for a service in the nature of industrial
insurance. That it lies in their way to furnish such protection
under modern economic practice is an indisputable fact.</p>

<p>This nice question is almost daily pressing for solution at
the hands of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It arises
every time an increase of freight rates occurs. Take, for example,
the Pacific coast lumber cases of 1908. The dissenting
opinions of the Commission show how debatable the proposition
is.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Up to about 1893 the lumber interests of the Pacific
coast were quite undeveloped and entirely dependent upon
water transportation for reaching markets. At this time low
rates of forty to sixty cents per hundred pounds on forest products
to markets in the Middle West were introduced, partly
to build up the industry and partly to create a back loading
for the preponderantly westbound tonnage of all transcontinental
lines. Under these rates the business has enormously
developed until, on the Northern Pacific road in 1906, the shipments
of lumber east bound amounted to one-third of its entire
traffic both ways, and yielded nearly one-fifth of its freight
revenue. So greatly had this traffic expanded that it aided,
if not actually produced, a reversal of the direction of transcontinental
empties. Practically all these roads now have an
excess of tonnage to the east whereas ten years ago much the
larger volume of freight was moving westward. Meantime
the lumbermen under the stimulus of these lower rates, and
of the phenomenal rise in the price of lumber, had been wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>fully
prosperous. The price of logs had risen since 1893 from
about $2.50 per 1,000 feet to $13.50 in 1906; partly in consequence
of the extraordinary demand consequent on the Valparaiso
and San Francisco earthquakes. The mills had moved
in from the rivers and the coast, and had become absolutely
dependent upon rail transportation for reaching markets. At
this stage, and most unfortunately in November, 1907, just at
a time of industrial panic, the carriers raised their rates by
about ten cents per one hundred pounds. The market price
of logs had already dropped from $13.50 per thousand by
approximately one-third. These two causes, commercial depression
and the increased freight rate, brought about a complete
collapse in the industry. And the increased freight
rates were contested before the Interstate Commerce Commission
in the hope that, as in the southern field the rate increases
from Georgia points had been annulled,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> these might also be
found unreasonable. The broad question concerns the obligation
of carriers, once having brought about an investment of
capital in the industry, to continue to give the same rates as
those under which the ventures had been undertaken, due
regard being had, of course, to such changes in costs of service
as might have ensued. The lumbermen demand that all the
increment of profit due to prosperous developments shall remain
unto them; in other words, that the carriers' share of the
increased values shall remain fixed. On the other hand, the
railways defend their increases, partly upon the ground of
increasing expenses of operation, and partly upon the broader
ground that the freight rate being proportioned to the price
of the product, should rise in harmony with it. Upon this
question the Commission was divided, the majority holding
in favor of annulling the increase, while the chairman and one
other member decided that the increase was justifiable.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Elasticity and quick adaptation to the exigencies of business
are peculiarities of American railway operation. Our railway
managers have always been most progressive in seeking, in
and out of season, to develop new territory and build up traffic.
The strongest contrast between Europe and the United States
lies in this fact. European railways more often take business
as they find it. Our railways <i>make</i> it. Much of this business
is made possible only by special rates adapted to the case in
hand. These need not be secret or discriminating, as has
already been observed. For although offered with reference
to particular cases, they may be open to all comers. The
economic justification lies in the fact that the railway can
afford to make a low rate, leaving a bare margin of profit above
the <i>extra</i> cost of adding this traffic to that which is already
in motion. Such rates cannot exceed a definite figure based
upon what the traffic will bear. A higher rate than this would
kill the business. Something is contributed toward fixed
charges by the new traffic, so far as the railway is concerned; and
at the same time the shipper on his part is enabled to enlarge
his operations. Yet such a scale of rates if applied to the whole
traffic of the railway might be ruinous in the extreme. The
domestic shipper of wheat may conceivably be helped, rather
than injured, by a special rate on grain for Liverpool without
which the railway would lose the business entirely. To transport
California fruit for a mere fraction of the rate per ton mile
which is laid upon other traffic may actually enable those other
goods to be carried more cheaply than before. Of course, if
the other traffic be directly competitive, as for instance in this
case, oranges from Florida, that is an entirely different matter.
Railway representatives rightfully insist upon these special
rates to develop new business as a boon to the commercial
world. They contrast them with the hard and fast schedules
of European railways. They allege that such elasticity loosens
the joints of competition, "keeps everyone in business," equalizes
prices over large areas, and is in fact the life of trade. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of the stock objections to railway regulation is that it may
lessen this elasticity, "substitute mile posts for brains," and
produce stagnation in place of activity.</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, a certain rigidity of rate schedules
is a natural consequence of the very delicacy with which
individual rates are adjusted to meet the demands of trade.
Each road is jealously and aggressively alert to protect its own
constituency regardless of the rights of others. No single
traffic manager is free to grant reductions of rates, even when
considered to be just, by reason of the opposition of competing
lines. The consent of every one of these interests is necessary
in order to insure stability, and the penalty for acting independently
may be a rate war, disastrously affecting relations
with connecting lines. Thus, for example, in the South the
Southern Railway for some time was willing to concede, as a
measure of justice, a reduction of rates on cotton from Mississippi
river points to the mills in North and South Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
The growth of the textile industry had resulted in a demand
for cotton far exceeding the production of the Carolinas. At
the same time the increasing attention devoted to manufacturing
of a higher grade had forced the manufacturers to draw
upon the long-staple supplies of the Mississippi bottom lands.
The Piedmont cotton was too short in fibre for the finer sort
of goods. The Carolina mills were, however, compelled to
pay a higher rate upon cotton from such points as Memphis
than was paid for the long haul up to New England. Thus,
for instance, as late as 1900, rates were fifty-nine cents to South
Carolina, while they were only fifty-five and one-half cents
per hundred pounds from the same points to New England
mills. This was obviously unjust. But the Southern Railway
alone, interested in the welfare of its Carolina clients, was
powerless to act without the consent of its competitors operating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>from Memphis west of the Alleghanies. These latter lines,
having no interest in the southern mills and a unity of interest
in the long haul traversed to New England, sought to prevent
an equalization of the differences. Controlling rates also on
cotton for export to various seaports, they were for a long
time able to prevent a change. On the other hand, in the
same territory the railways operating south from Cincinnati
and Louisville desired to reduce rates on manufactured products
from the Central West.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> These were the very lines which
in the former instance prevented the reduction of cotton rates
on the Southern Railway to Carolina points, by threats to
meet such reductions by cutting their own rates on cotton
going north through the Ohio gateways. Yet a reduction of
their rates on manufactures for building up western trade
threatened the business of the Southern Railway, which had
been mainly interested in the traffic from Atlanta seaboard
points. It may readily be seen that this situation, extending
to practically every important point, "jacked up" all these
rates, not because of their inherent reasonableness and not
even because the railways independently acknowledged them
to be just, but simply and solely because any disturbance of
this house of cards might lead to a general downfall of the
whole system.</p>

<p>Another interesting example of the difficulty of bringing
about a change in rate adjustment is afforded in the transcontinental
field. For some years a general agreement seems
to have been adopted as a sort of a compromise between the
various conflicting interests. Under present conditions Chicago
and all points east of the Mississippi from Maine to Florida
enjoy precisely the same rate to the Pacific coast.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Chicago
has at various times contended before the Interstate Commerce
Commission for graded rates which should recognize, for
instance, that being 1,200 miles nearer San Francisco than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Boston on the basis of distance, it should have proportionately
lower freight rates. Apparently some of the transcontinental
roads, such as the Great Northern, have been willing to make
this concession. They could not, however, take any action
without first obtaining the consent of every railway and steamship
company with which they compete. Inasmuch as almost
every railway in the country participates in transcontinental
business, an agreement was practically impossible. Entirely
aside from the merits of this particular intricate question, it
must be borne in mind that there is no such thing as independence
of action on behalf of any single carrier. It becomes
exceedingly easy for one road to play a dog-in-the-manger
part. The shipper may be subjected to an extortionate policy,
not dictated by the road over which he ships, as a matter of fact,
but by roads operating perhaps a thousand or more miles away.</p>

<p>Praiseworthy as is the elasticity of railway rates in the
United States, there is, nevertheless, much to be said in support
of the contention that at times this has been carried to an
extreme. Stability and certainty have been treated as of
secondary importance. Particular shippers have been aided,
but the general interests of trade have suffered some injurious
consequences. It is not entirely clear whether the advantage
gained from elasticity has at all times been worth the cost.
Certain of the disadvantages of instability of rates seem to
have been overlooked.</p>

<p>In the first place railway tariffs have in the past undoubtedly
been too voluminous and complex. The number of these filed
with the Interstate Commerce Commission is extremely large.
Eleven railways alone during the year to November 30, 1904,
filed 30,125. The total schedules of all American railways
filed during the year to November 30, 1907, was 220,982. One
single carrier had 15,700 tariffs in force at the same time. The
New York Central &amp; Hudson River in December, 1899, had
no less than 1,370 special commodity rates in force. There
were endless contradictions and conflicts. Secret rates were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
hidden in devious ways in this mass of publications. Special
tariffs "expiring with this shipment"; rates quoted not numerically
but by numbered reference to tariffs of other carriers and
applicable by different routes; agreements to meet rates of any
competing carriers, were among the irregular methods of concealment
adopted. Although literally complying with the law
by publicly filing all tariffs, conditions were often such that
not even an expert in rates could discover in this maze of conflicting
evidence what the rate at any time actually was. The
door was opened wide to personal discrimination and abuses of
all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Those conditions are not necessary. They do not
obtain on the best roads in other parts of the world. Nor is
such instability found in respect of some important lines of
trade. No agricultural product fluctuates in price more abruptly
or widely than raw cotton,&mdash;from five to seventeen cents
a pound. Yet the rates on that commodity have remained
quite undisturbed throughout the southern states for many
years. But the best proof of all that rates have been unduly
numerous, is the great reduction in volume which has taken
place since 1910 under compulsion of law. This feature will
be especially considered in another connection.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The second disadvantage of too great elasticity in freight
rates is that it may, at times, promote rather than lessen that
state of economic unrest inevitable in all business, especially
in a new country. Under a continual disturbance of rates, the
merchant is unable with security to enter into long-time contracts.
Rates are sometimes changed, not to suit the shipper
but to serve the railway's interests. Sometimes traffic may be
diverted from its natural channels. The spirit of initiative
and self-reliance on the part of shippers may be undermined.
Persistent titillation of competition may be pleasant for a time,
but its final results may be injurious. Constant appeal to the
traffic manager of his road for aid and comfort may quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>naturally divert the shipper's attention from an aggressive
commercial policy which would render him independent of
minor changes in freight rates. The more responsibility the
traffic manager assumes, the more may be put upon him. And
it must always be remembered that each move by one road to
protect a client, will probably be checkmated by the tactics of
rival lines. Economic peace, not warfare, should be encouraged
by the services of common carriers. One of the positive advantages
of governmental regulation of railway rates is that
it contributes to stability. That this view is shared by experienced
railway men, appears from the following testimony of
President Mellen of the New Haven road.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> "I think that great
trouble comes to the business of this country through the fact
of these little breaks in rates. During November two new railways
were opened into the city of Denver. They sought to
make themselves popular by lowering rates, and rates went
down very low. They went down legally, but they went down
very low. Just before the rates went down the merchants
of the city had stocked Denver with goods and the lowering of
the rates demoralized their prices; they lost a large amount of
money, and dissatisfaction was caused from Chicago to Denver.
Lowering of rates demoralized business generally. I think
if those roads had known that the rates which they made had
to remain in force thirty days they would have hesitated before
they lowered them. I would increase the time required
before rates could be reduced."</p>

<p>The foregoing consideration suggests still another argument
in favor of stability of freight rates, even at the expense
of a certain amount of flexibility. Special rates which create
new business should be carefully distinguished from special
rates which merely wrest business from other carriers or markets.
Any expedient which will make two blades of grass grow where
one grew before; which puts American wheat into Liverpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
in competition with India and Argentina; which cheapens
California fruit on the eastern markets; which offers a wider
choice of building stone for Chicago; which will establish new
industries for the utilization of local raw materials, deserves
the greatest encouragement. Our country has been unprecedentedly
developed in consequence of the energy and progressiveness
of its railway managers. But thousands of other
special rates have no such justification, even where they are
public and open to all shippers alike. These are the expression
of railway ambition to build up trade by invading territory
naturally tributary to other railways or traders. A significant
feature of commercial competition is the utilization of distant
markets as available "dumping grounds" for the surplus products
left over from the local or natural market. In the St.
Louis Business Men's League case<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the Pacific coast jobbers
complained that the large distributing houses in the Middle
West thus invaded their territory. Having met their fixed
charges from their own natural territory, they invaded the
remotest districts by cutting prices to the level of actual production
cost per unit of new business. The Florida orange
growers protest against the relatively lower rate on California
fruit, which is carried twice the distance for less money per
box. This, it is urged, enables the western grower, having
glutted his natural market in the Middle West, to "dump" his
surplus into the eastern field, to which alone the Florida orange
is restricted. This line of argument is the same as that which
upholds the systems under which lower rates are given for
exported or imported commodities than those on goods for
domestic consumption. It is always alleged that such sales
at long reach actually benefit the consumer or producer near
at hand, inasmuch as they contribute something toward the
fixed expenses of the business, which must be borne in any
event. This raises at once the much broader question as to
what constitutes a "natural market" or the "natural territory"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>which rightfully belongs to any given economic agent. It is,
however, too extended an issue to be discussed at this time.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Too many special commodity rates, intended to meet the
needs of particular shippers instead of increasing new business,
may merely bring about economic waste through exchange
between widely separated markets or by causing an invasion
of fields naturally tributary to other centres.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Whenever a
community producing a surplus of a given commodity supplies
itself, nevertheless, with that same commodity from a distant
market, economic loss results. Numerous instances could be
cited where identical products are redistributed after a long
carriage to and from a distant point in the very area of original
production. Dried fruits may be distributed by wholesale
grocers at Chicago in the great fruit-raising regions of the
West and South. Cotton goods made by southern mills may
be shipped to New York or Chicago, and then sent back again
for final distribution with the addition of a middleman's commission
and a double freight rate. The Colorado Fuel &amp;
Iron Company seeks special rates in order to sell goods over in
Pittsburg territory; while its great competitor, the United
States Steel Corporation, has an equal ambition for the trade
of the Pacific Slope. In another case it appeared that a sash
and blind manufacturer in Detroit was seeking to extend his
market in New England. Manufacturers of the same goods
in Vermont were simultaneously marketing their product in
Michigan. The Detroit producer did not complain of this
invasion of his home territory, but objected to the freight rate
from Boston to Detroit, which, probably because of back loading,
was only about one-half the rate on his own goods from
Detroit to the seaboard. Is not this an economic anomaly?
Two producers, presumably of equal efficiency, are each invading
the territory naturally tributary to the other and are enabled
to do so by reason of the railway policy of "keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>everyone in business." The New England railways are compelled
by reason of the remoteness to their territory to defend
this policy. As President Tuttle, of the Boston &amp; Maine,
expresses it, "I should be just as much interested in the stimulating
of Chicago manufacturers in sending their products
into New England to sell as I would be in sending those from
New England into Chicago to sell. It is the business of the
railways centering in Chicago to send the products from Chicago
in every direction. It is our particular business in New
England to send New England products all over the country.
The more they scatter the better it is for the railways. The
railway does not discriminate against shipments because they
are east bound or west bound. We are glad to see the same
things come from Chicago into New England that are manufactured
and sent from New England into Chicago." No one
questions for a moment that the widening of the sphere of
competition by transportation agencies is a service of incalculable
benefit to the country. But it should also be borne in
mind that superfluous transportation is economic waste. The
industrial combinations in seeking to effect a strategic location
of their factories in order to divide the field have apparently
come to a full recognition of this fact.</p>

<p>A fourth objection to undue development of special commodity
rates is that they may entail increased burdens upon
the local constituency of each railway. The proportion of
such special rates is fifty per cent greater in America than in
the United Kingdom. It is plain that each shipment which
fails to bear its due proportion of fixed charges, even though
contributing something thereto, leaves the weight of interest
and maintenance charges upon the shoulders of the local shipper.
To be sure, those special rates which permanently create new
business, operate otherwise. But in the vast complex, each
railway often wrests from competing carriers only about as
much tonnage as it loses. It invades rival territory, but its
own constituency is invaded in retaliation. Thus there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
rolled up an inordinately large proportion of such special
traffic, leaving the regular shipments and the local trade to
bear the brunt of fixed charges. Momentous social consequences
may result. Not only the cost of doing business, but
the expense of living in the smaller places is increased. One
of the most dangerous social tendencies at the present time is
the enormous concentration of population and wealth in great
cities. Increased efficiency and economy in production are
much to be desired; but social and political stability must not
be sacrificed thereto. Is it not possible that a powerful decentralizing
influence may be exerted by checking this indiscriminate
and often wasteful long-distance competition, through
greater insistence upon the rights of geographical location?</p>

<p>Finally, an abnormal disregard of distance, which is always
possible in the making of special rates to meet particular cases,
may bring about a certain inelasticity of industrial conditions.
This may occur in either one of two ways. The rise of new
industries may be hindered; or the well-merited relative decline
of old ones under a process of natural selection may be
postponed or averted. The difficult problem of fairly adjusting
rates on raw materials to finished products in order that the
growth of new industries may take place, while at the same
time the old established ones shall not be cramped or restricted,
has already been discussed. It is equally plain that at times
there may be danger of perpetuating an industry in a district,
regardless of the physical disabilities under which it is conducted.
One cannot for a moment doubt the advantages of a
protective policy on the part of railways; safe-guarding industry
against violent dislocating shocks. An inevitable transition
to new and perhaps better conditions may perhaps be
rendered easier to bear. To New England, constantly exposed
to the competition of new industries rising in the West, this
policy has been of inestimable value. On the other hand, it is
incontestable that in the long run the whole country will fare
best when each industry is prosecuted in the most favored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
location, conditions of marketing as well as of mere production
being always considered. If Pittsburg is the natural centre
for iron and steel production, it may not be an unmixed advantage
to the country at large, however great its value to
New England, to have the carriers perpetuate the barbed wire
manufacturers at Worcester. If California can raise a finer
or more marketable variety of orange, and at a lower cost,
than Florida, it would be a backward step to counteract the
natural advantage of the western field by compelling the southern
railways to reduce their rates to an amount equal to the
disability under which the Florida grower works. The principle
laid down by the so-called "Bogue differentials" in the
lumber trade<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> bears upon this point. In order to equalize
conditions between a large number of lumbering centres sending
their products to a common market, certain differentials
between them were allowed under arbitration, "to enable each
line to place its fair proportion of lumber in the territory."
Did this mean that the disability of any place in manufacturing
cost, should be compensated by a corresponding reduction
in the ensuing transportation cost? This was the view of
some of the carriers who were zealous to keep the market open
to all on equal terms. Yet it is evident that, carried beyond
a certain point, such a policy would not only nullify all advantages
of geographical location, but it would also reverse
the process of natural selection and of survival of the fittest,
upon which all industrial progress must ultimately depend.
Each particular case, however, must be decided on its merits.
Our purpose is not to pass judgment on any one, but merely
to call attention to the possible effect of such practices upon
the process of industrial development.</p>

<p>Centralization, or concentration of population, industry and
wealth is characteristic of all progressive peoples at the present
time. Great economic advantages, through division of labor
and cheapened production, have resulted; but, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
hand, manifold evils have followed in its train. Sometimes it
appears as if American railway practices, in granting commodity
and flat long-distance rates so freely, operated in some
ways to retard this tendency. But the influence is not all in
that direction. Many staple industries, utilizing the raw material
at their doors, might supply the needs of their several
local constituencies, were it not that their rise is prevented
by long-distance rates from remote but larger centres of production.
Denver, in striving to establish paper mills to utilize
its own Colorado wood pulp, is threatened by the low rates
from Wisconsin centres. Each locality, ambitious to become
self-supporting, is hindered by the persistency of competition
from far away cities. This is particularly true of distributive
business. The overweening ambition of the great cities to
monopolize the jobbing trade, regardless of distance, has already
been discussed. And it follows, of course, that the larger the
city the more forcibly may it press its demands upon the carriers
for low rates to the most remote hamlets. The files of
the Interstate Commerce Commission are stocked with examples
of this kind. The plea of the smaller cities and the agricultural
states&mdash;Iowa, for example&mdash;for a right to share in the
jobbing naturally tributary to them by reason of their location,
formed no inconsiderable element in the recent popular demand
for legislation by the Federal government.</p>

<p>The marked difference between competition in transportation
and trade has long been recognized in economic writing,
but has not as yet been accorded due weight in law. The most
essential difference arises from the fact, already fully set forth,
that a large proportion of railway expenditures are entirely
independent of the amount of business done. This involves
as a consequence, the exemption of carriers from the fundamental
law of evolution. Survival of the fittest does not
obtain as a rule in railway competition. The poorest equipped,
the most circuitous and most nearly insolvent road is often
able to dictate terms to the standard and most direct trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
lines. This has been exemplified time and again in the history
of rate wars the world over.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The bankrupt road having repudiated
its fixed charges has nothing to lose by carrying
business at any figure which will pay the mere cost of haulage.
The indirect line having no business at the outset has nothing
to lose, and everything to gain. The Canadian Pacific, for
example, was perhaps originally built without any expectation
of being able to participate in San Francisco business; and
yet, like the Grand Trunk, it has always been an active factor
in the determination of transcontinental tariffs.</p>

<p>The fact is that cost of production, while in trade fixing a
point below which people may refuse to produce or compete, in
transportation may merely mark the point at which it becomes
more wasteful to stop producing than to go on producing at a
loss. Hadley's classic statement is so admirable that it cannot
be improved upon. "Let us take an instance from railway
business, here made artificially simple for the sake of
clearness, but in its complicated forms occurring every day.
A railway connects two places not far apart, and carries from
one to the other (say) 100,000 tons of freight a month at twenty-five
cents a ton. Of the $25,000 thus earned, $10,000 is paid
out for the actual expenses of running the trains and loading
or unloading the cars; $5000 for repairs and general expenses;
the remaining $10,000 pays the interest on the cost of construction.
Only the first of these items varies in proportion
to the amount of business done; the interest is a fixed charge,
and the repairs have to be made with almost equal rapidity,
whether the material wears out, rusts out, or washes out. Now
suppose a parallel road is built, and in order to secure some
of this business offers to take it at twenty cents a ton. The
old road must meet the reduction in order not to lose its business,
even though the new figure does not leave it a fair profit
on its investment; better a moderate profit than none at all.
The new road reduces to fifteen cents; so does the old road.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>A fifteen cent rate will not pay interest unless there are new
business conditions developed by it; but it will pay for repairs,
which otherwise would be a dead loss. The new road makes a
still further reduction to eleven cents. This will do little toward
paying repairs, but that little is better than nothing. If
you take at eleven cents freight that cost you twenty-five cents
to handle, you lose fourteen cents on every ton you carry. If
you refuse to take it at that rate, you lose fifteen cents on every
ton you do not carry. For your charges for interest and repairs
run on, while the other road gets the business."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Another peculiarity of railway competition, distinguishing
it from competition in trade, is that there is no such thing as
abandonment of the field. This is tersely expressed by Morawetz
in his Corporation Law. "It should be observed that
competition among railway companies has not the same safeguard
as competition in trade. Persons will ordinarily do business
only when they see a fair chance of profit, and if press
of competition renders a particular trade unprofitable, those
engaged in that trade will suspend or reduce their operations,
and apply their capital or labor to other uses until a reasonable
margin of profit is reached. But the capital invested in the construction
of a railway cannot be withdrawn when competition
renders the operation of the road unprofitable. A railway is
of no use except for railway purposes, and if the operation of
the road were stopped, the capital invested in its construction
would be wholly lost. Hence it is for the interest of the railway
company to operate its road, though the earnings are
barely sufficient to pay the operating expenses. The ownership
of the road may pass from the shareholders to the bond-holders,
and be of no profit to the latter; but the struggle for
traffic will continue so long as the means of paying operating
expenses can be raised. Unrestricted competition will thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
render the competitive traffic wholly unremunerative, and will
cause the ultimate bankruptcy of the companies unless the
operation of their traffic which is not the subject of competition
can be made to bear the entire burden of the interest and
fixed charges." So profoundly modified in short are the conditions
of railway competition by contrast with those in industry,
that it is clear beyond a shadow of doubt that a railway
is essentially a monopoly. This requires no proof so far as
local business, in distinction from through or competitive traffic,
is concerned. It is equally true in respect to all traffic of
sufficient importance to bring about pooling agreements or a
division of the business, in order to forfend bankruptcy and
consolidation. To attempt to perpetuate competition between
railways by legislation is thus defeating its own end. The
prohibition of pooling agreements which refuses to recognize
the naturally monopolistic character of the business, can have
but one result, namely, to compel consolidation as a measure
of self-preservation. Such legislation defeats itself, bringing
about the very result it was intended to prevent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two general theories governing the rates chargeable by railways
are entertained, known respectively as cost of service and
value of service. According to the first, the proper rate for
transportation should be based upon the cost for carriage of
the persons or goods, with an allowance for a reasonable profit
over and above the expenses of operation involved. This line
of argument is commonly advanced by representatives of
shippers and the public, who reason by analogy from other
lines of business. In several European countries when railways
were first built, and afterward, especially in Germany in
1867, attempts were made to apply this principle widely in the
construction of tariffs. Practical railway men, on the other
hand, usually adhere to the second principle of value of service.
This argument maintains that, while theoretically cost of
service should determine minimum rates, owing to the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of commercial competition, as a matter of fact rates must be
based upon the principle of charging what the traffic will bear.
This is accomplished by proportioning the rate to the commercial
value of the service. Practically the rate is found by
charging as much as the traffic will stand without evidence of
discouragement. Thus if the price per bushel of wheat in
New York is twenty-five cents higher than in Chicago, it would
obviously be absurd to charge a rate which would absorb all
of that increment of place value due to transportation. Enough
margin must be left to the shipper who buys wheat in Chicago
and sells it in New York, to permit a reasonable profit on the
transaction, after payment of the freight rate.</p>

<p>These two principles of cost of service and value of service
are directly opposed in one regard; inasmuch as the cost of
service theory harks directly back to railway expenditure;
while the value of service principle contemplates primarily the
effect upon the railway's income account. Any charge is
justified according to the latter view, which is not detrimental
to the shipper as indicated by a positive reduction in the volume
of business offered. No charge, on the other hand, may
be deemed reasonable according to the cost of service principle,
which affords more than a fair profit upon the business,
regardless of its effect upon the shipper. As a matter of fact
neither of these views is entirely sound by itself. Both have
large elements of truth in them. Each qualifies the other. In
the first place, it is to be noted that between them they fix the
upper and lower limits of all possible charges. Less than the
cost of service cannot be charged; else would a confiscatory
rate result. This was the plea set up by the railways in the now
celebrated Texas Cattle Raisers' Association case against the
cancellation by the Interstate Commerce Commission of an
extra charge of $1 per car for switching charges at Chicago.
At the other extreme, more than the traffic will bear cannot be
charged without a disproportionate decline in volume of tonnage.
This would be bad business policy, as it could at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
entail loss of revenue. The railway could not submit to the
former alternative; it would not conceivably resort to the latter.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made by various authors to account for
the phenomena of rate making on other grounds. The German
author, Sax, has sought to trace an analogy between the
imposition of taxes and railway charges, alleging that both
should be proportioned to what the shipper "can afford to
pay," from an ethical rather than an economic point of view.
Acworth interprets the phrase "charging what the traffic will
bear" to mean something analogous to this. His allegation is
that rate schedules are built up upon the principle of "equality
of sacrifice," otherwise characterized as "tempering the wind to
the shorn lamb." High class traffic contributes liberally of its
abundance of value, while third class passengers and low
grade tonnage are let off lightly on the ground of their poverty.
Taussig in his memorable contribution to the subject<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> has,
however, shown how untenable this theory of "equality of
sacrifice" is. Not ethical but purely economic considerations
are applicable in such circumstances except, of course, in so far
as common carriers, enjoying privileges by grant of the state,
may be considered as imposing taxes for the performance of a
quasi-public duty. This latter test of a reasonable rate has
underlaid a long line of Supreme Court decisions since the
Granger case.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Nevertheless, as so frequently happens, legal
and economic bases of judgment seem to be lacking in harmony.</p>

<p>There can be no question that for an indispensable public
service like transportation, conducted under monopolistic conditions,
the ideal system of charges would be to ascertain the
cost of each service rendered and to allow a reasonable margin
of profit over and above this amount. To the application of
this principle alone, however, there are several insuperable objections
both theoretical and practical. Such cost is practically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>indeterminate, being joint for all services in large part, as
we have seen: it is highly variable, being perhaps never twice
the same, as circumstances change from time to time; cost is
unknown until volume is ascertained, and volume is ever
fluctuating; the cost of service, obviously, could never be ascertained
until after the service had been rendered, while, of
course, the schedule of rates must be known in advance, in
order that the shipper may calculate his probable profits; and
finally the principle of increasing returns, flowing from the
dependence of cost upon volume of traffic, imposes such an
incentive for development of new business, which in turn depends
for its volume upon the rate charged, that cost of service
is subordinated at once to other considerations in practice.</p>

<p>Of these objections to rate making upon the principle of
cost of service alone, it would indeed appear as if the first
should be conclusive. If the cost is simply indeterminable,
why bother about any further refutation of the principle at
all? But the persistency of the idea that somehow railway
operations are analogous to the business of an ordinary merchant;
and that cost and profits are ascertainable; renders
it necessary to pile proof upon proof of the limitations upon its
applicability to real conditions in service.</p>

<p>Not only is the mere cost of service indeterminable; if it
could be ascertained, it would not establish the chargeable rate
in many instances. The freight service of a railway comprises
the carriage of all kinds of goods simultaneously, from the
most valuable high-priced commodities, such as silks and
satins, down to lumber, coal, cement, and even sand.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> To
compel each of these classes of goods to bear its proportionate
share of the cost of carriage, would at once preclude the possibility
of transporting low-priced goods at all. One dollar
a hundred pounds may not be too much to add to the price of
boots and shoes for transportation from Boston to Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>It would still form only a small part of the total cost of producing
and marketing them. But to add anything like that sum
to the cost of one hundred pounds of salt or cement would put
an end to the business at once. Only about so much can in
practice be added to the price of any given commodity for
freight without widely limiting the area of its available market.
Thus raw cotton seems to be able to bear an addition of about
fifty cents per hundred pounds for freight to its total cost.
Experience demonstrates that anything more than this one-half
cent per pound charged on cotton, entails more loss than
gain. In the case of fancy groceries or fine furniture, there
may be no considerable demand in any event above a certain
ascertainable level of prices. For boots and shoes or cut building
stone it may be that competition from some other centre
of production nearby, precludes any great addition to the
price for freight. The business simply will not bear more
than a certain proportion of charge. Not only would the
rigid application of the cost of service principle hinder all transportation
of low-grade traffic; it would also prevent any development
of long distance business. It is indubitable that
sole reliance upon cost of service as a basis for rate making is
theoretically unsound, and impossible of practical application.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Cost of service, while unsound as a sole reliance, nevertheless
affords an important check upon the value of service principle.
Without it there is always grave danger that traffic
managers, seeking to enlarge their revenues, may push rates
unreasonably high. At first sight it would appear as if this
could not occur, inasmuch as an inordinately high rate would
immediately reduce the volume of business offered. It is constantly
alleged by railway men that this must of necessity
occur. And it would indeed follow, were it not that the incidence
of the rate is rarely upon the actual shipper. He merely
pays it, and at once shifts it to the consumer. For low-grade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
or staple goods like cement or kerosene, where transportation
charges form a large part of the total cost of production,
it is conceivable that higher freight rates might so far increase
the price as to check consumption. Five cents a hundredweight
higher freight means $1.25 per 1,000 ft. added to the
price of soft lumber, $2 to hard lumber; three cents per bushel
added to the price of wheat, and $1 to the ton of pig iron or
coal. Such substantial additions might readily reduce the
demand. Yet even this would not be true of necessities of
life like anthracite coal or sugar, on which latter the freight
rate amounts to about one-half cent per pound. Is five cents
a barrel added to the price of flour likely to decrease the consumption
of that staple commodity? Yet the enhancement of
railway revenues would indeed be enormous from such an increase
of freight rates. For these necessities of life, an increased
freight rate might become an actual charge upon the
people, without reducing their consumption, like a tax upon
salt. Only upon goods the use of which might be freely lessened,
would higher freight rates be reflected in a corresponding
decline in the volume of business. Moreover, with all high
grade traffic, the value of service principle fails utterly by
itself alone to prescribe the upper level of a reasonable charge.
Competent testimony is ample upon this point. Thus from
the commissioner of the Trunk Line Association;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> "The
tonnage of the higher class articles is an extremely difficult
matter for transportation companies to increase or decrease....
In that class of articles the carrier can do but little
to increase the transportation." And the reason in part lies in
the almost immediate diffusion of the burden in the processes
of distribution. That no complaints are made&mdash;a defence
often brought forward for higher rates&mdash;proves by itself
the uncertain incidence of the burden imposed.</p>

<p>That the principle of charging what the traffic will bear
affords no protection to the consumer against exorbitant rates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
on many commodities, follows also from the relative insignificance
of transportation charges as compared with the value
of the goods. This, in fact, is naively conceded by railway
managers themselves; when, as in the case of the widespread
freight rate advances of 1908-1909, publicity agents flooded the
country with calculations as to the infinitesimal fraction which
would be added to the price of commodities by a ten per cent,
rise in rates.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The rate from Grand Rapids to Chicago on an
ordinary dining room set of furniture, being $1.60, a ten per
cent. increase would add only sixteen cents to the cost. A
harvester transported one hundred miles would be enhanced
seventeen and a half cents in price; a kitchen stove carried from
Detroit to the Mississippi would only cost twenty-five cents
more; and the price of a Michigan refrigerator sold in New York,
would be only seven and one-half cents higher; were freight
rates to be increased by ten per cent, in each instance. On
wearing apparel the proportions were represented as even
more striking. An ordinary suit of clothes transported three
hundred miles, under similarly enhanced rates, would, it was
alleged, cost only one-third of a cent more. For all their
apparel, made in New England, consisting of everything from
hats to shoes, each wearer in the Middle West would be affected
by a ten per cent. rise of rates by less than one cent apiece.
True enough all this; and a striking testimonial to the effectiveness
of the railway service of the country! But at the
same time, if a ten per cent. increase of rates is inappreciable
to the consumer, why not increase them by twenty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>And what becomes of the argument that charging rates according
to what the traffic will bear, is an ample safeguard
against extortion? Many of these small changes in price are
diffused in the friction of retail trade;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> some of them are unfortunately
magnified to the consumer, especially under conditions
of monopoly. When freight rates on beef go up ten
cents per hundredweight, the consumers' price is more likely
than not to rise by ten times that amount. But even assuming
the final cost to follow the range of transportation charges
closely, is it not evident that, so small relatively are many
freight charges by comparison with other costs of production,
that consumption is not proportionately affected by their
movement one way or the other? And yet the entire argument
that the value of service principle is a self-governing engine
against unreasonable rates, is based upon this assumption.
Surely the increased income to the carriers when rates are
raised must come from someone. Because it is not felt, is no
reason for denying its existence as a tax. But the very fact
that it is not felt, undermines the argument that a safeguard
against extortion obtains. The theorem that value of service
in itself affords a reliable basis for rate making, pre-supposes
that freight rates and prices move in unison; a supposition
which a moment's consideration shows to be untenable in
fact.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Such cases must be finally settled by some reference,
indefinite though it be, to the cost of conducting that particular
service; or rather, as Lorenz puts it, to the extra cost incident
to that service. This extra cost may oftentimes be
segregated, where the total cost could not be ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>That the problem is, however, a most difficult one is evidenced
by the periodic controversies over railway mail pay.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Of course in order that any change of rates should be reflected
in prices, all carriers must of necessity agree upon the
matter. The price is made by the least expensive source of
supply. So that any carrier refusing to raise rates, might aid
in the continuance of an already established price. Under
conditions of transportation prevalent in the United States
twenty years ago, the likelihood of an increased freight rate
becoming a tax upon the community, was lessened by the
probability that either by means of secret rebates, or by special
and perhaps open commodity rates, some roads might choose
to protect their clients against enhancement of prices. Markets
were local&mdash;not reached by great systems operating from remote
sources of supply. The policy of the northern transcontinental
lines in making lumber rates from Oregon to the
Middle West, might be quite independent of any policy in force
on the southern hard pine carrying roads. But under present
day conditions, the entire area of the United States is one
great market. Hence, with rebates eliminated and with practical
monopoly established through actual consolidation, control
or harmony of policy, the carriers have the consumers
much more completely at their mercy. Only two safeguards
for the public interest remain. One is government regulation,
or at all events supervision, of charges. The other is "enlightened
self-interest"&mdash;which in transportation matters
means a full appreciation of the possibilities and limitations
in the application of the value of service principle to the
determination of rates.</p>

<p>Considerations of cost of service afford protection, not only
against unreasonably high rates, but also against unduly low
charges. The evil in such cases is not only that the carriers
operate at a loss, but that inequality and discrimination are
inevitable concomitants of too low rates. No railway conceivably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of course, will charge unremunerative rates for a long
time. But it sometimes happens that managements may be
led to the adoption of policies of temporary expediency, not
compatible with the long-time welfare of stockholders. During
the presidency of Charles Francis Adams on the Northern
Pacific in 1890 an unaccountable and unnatural diversion of
traffic from this road to the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
suddenly occurred.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> A large volume of freight from the East
to Oregon was diverted to the roundabout route <i>via</i> Southern
California. On investigation it appeared that the English
banking house of Baring Brothers, having become involved in
unfortunate Argentine speculation, and being obliged to force
a market for its investments in Atchison securities, demanded
an immediate showing of large gross earnings regardless of the
net profits. Orders to get traffic at any price went forth. A
market was made for Atchison stock; although it was powerless
to prevent the firm's final bankruptcy. In such a case the
only safeguard against unreasonably depressed rates by the
Atchison road, which, of course, immediately compelled corresponding
reductions by the natural routes to the Northwest,
should have been consideration of the actual cost of moving
traffic by so long and roundabout a route. And yet this consideration
was entirely ignored. Another illustration of the
same danger occurred in April, 1903.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> A gang of western
speculators unobtrusively acquired control of the Louisville &amp;
Nashville road, by taking advantage of the issue by that company
of a large amount of new stock. This they did by the
use of borrowed money. They had no intention, even had they
been sufficiently well financed to do so, of permanently controlling
the road as an investment. They bought the stock
merely in order to resell it at a higher figure. They threatened
the railway world with a general disturbance of rate conditions
throughout the South. Their plan was to cut rates
and steal traffic from other roads in order to make a large show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>of gross earnings; and to unload their stock holdings on the
market thus made, before the public learned the truth. This
was prevented only by repurchase of their stock at very high
prices. In such a case, what guidance would the principle
of charging what the traffic would bear, afford? Cost of
service must be invoked in order to determine the reasonableness
of the low rates in force.</p>

<p>In any industry where rates are made under conditions of
monopoly rather than of free competition, it is imperative
that cost of service be constantly held in view. Under conditions
of free competition it is bound to obtrude itself automatically;
but under monopoly it must oftentimes be forcibly
invoked. The shipper whose manufacturing plant has once
been located in a certain place is no longer free to accept or
reject a certain rate. He can afford neither to move nor to
abandon his works. In order to continue in business he must
meet the prices made by competitors. This price may be made
elsewhere under more favored circumstances. To a manufacturer
an increase of freight rates instead of curtailing output,
may lead to attempts to lessen the costs of production per unit
by an enlarged output sold at cut prices. Under such conditions
an enhanced freight rate is a positive deduction from
profits without any gain to the consumer. It is impossible to
trace any safeguard against extortion in the operations of a
value of service law under such circumstances. An instance
in point is afforded by a complaint of the Detroit Chemical
works in 1908.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This company imported iron pyrites through
Baltimore from Spain; that being the source of the bulk of the
material used here in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. The
Detroit Company sold its product throughout the West in
competition with companies at St. Louis, Chicago and Buffalo.
The companies at Chicago and St. Louis enjoyed low import
rates by way of the Gulf ports. The Buffalo concern used to
be favored by a low rate said to be due to canal competition on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>shipments from New York. Since 1903, however, the rate on
pyrites from Baltimore to Detroit had been steadily increasing,
from $1.56 to $2.72 per long ton. Even this latter rate by
itself does not seem absolutely excessive, yielding a revenue
of less than four mills per ton mile. But here again, it was not
the absolute but the relative rate upon which the continued welfare
of the industrial concern depended. The question had to
be decided, not on the basis of cost, but from the point of view
of the value of the service to the user. The carriers after this
petition was filed voluntarily reduced the rate fifty-one cents
per ton in January, 1908. The relative rate as compared with
that to other competitive points was thus more equitably adjusted.
The Interstate Commerce Commission on a review of
the evidence held that this increase to $2.72 was unreasonable
and unjust so long as it had been in effect; and awarded reparation
to the amount of fifty-one cents per ton on all shipments
made during its continuance.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that the great dynamic force in railway
operation inheres in the value of service idea. The traffic manager
who is always considering how much it will cost to handle
business, will seldom adventure into new territory. The United
States, as a rapidly growing country, is consequently the field
in which charging what the traffic will bear, has been most
ardently upheld as the only practicable basis for rate making.
A few detailed illustrations will serve to show the results of its
application in practice. Not infrequently does it happen that
rates are different over the same line for shipments between
two given points in opposite directions. Where this is due to a
preponderance of traffic in one direction, and a consequent
movement of "empties" which invite a back loading at very
low rates, the difference of charges according to direction may
actually be due to differences in the cost of carriage.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> An
empty train, which must be returned from New York to Chicago
for another loading of grain, or to Georgia or Oregon for ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ments
of lumber, if loaded with merchandise, can be moved with
no allowance for dead weight of cars or locomotives; inasmuch
as the train must move in any event, whether loaded or empty.
But even where this defence of difference in the cost of service
fails, the practice may be entirely proper from every point of
view. By increasing the total tonnage a special rate may
ultimately contribute to lower charges all along the line. Raisin
culture began in California in 1876. Prior to that time the
Spanish product had supplied the American market. The first
thing to do was to find a market for the California raisins in the
East. They would not bear the freight rate which had previously
been charged for Spanish raisins moving over the
transcontinental lines westward. A very low rate was all
that the new traffic would bear. During the year 1876 therefore
70,000 lbs. of California raisins were carried east at one
and three-fourths cents per 100 lbs., while simultaneously
1,000,000 lbs. of Spanish raisins were carried west over the
same lines at a rate of three cents. No such difference in the
cost of service in opposite directions existed, although a preponderance
of empties moving eastward undoubtedly cheapened
the service from California. The aim of the commodity rate
was to upbuild a new industry. How far this succeeded appears
from the fact that in 1891, no Spanish raisins were carried west
at all; while the eastbound shipments amounted to 37,600,000
lbs.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The preceding illustration leads us then to this further
conclusion. The cost of service principle might most conceivably
be applied to a railway in a purely static state. But,
dynamically considered, as involving the growth and development
of business, it fails utterly by itself to meet the necessities
of the case.</p>

<p>At times it is inevitable that cost of service and value of
service considerations come flatly into opposition. Usually,
as in the California raisin case or in the grant of low rates
on Oregon lumber east bound about 1893, they reinforce one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
another; that is to say, the lower rate given to build up business
obtains on a service given at lower cost. But it sometimes
happens that shipments of the same commodities over a
line in opposite directions may occur and that the lower rate
applies to the (presumably) more costly service. In 1906
a manufacturer in Menasha, Wis., complained to the Interstate
Commerce Commission<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> that his rates on woodenware
to the Pacific slope were ten cents per 100 lbs. higher than were
rates on the same goods between the same points east bound,
<i>notwithstanding</i> the fact that the empty car mileage west
bound was then three times as great as in the contrary direction.
The movement of empties west bound would certainly
seem to justify as low if not lower rates on the basis of comparative
cost of operation, supposing that there was coincidence
in time. Only one satisfactory explanation for this
apparent anomaly suggests itself; viz., that this low eastbound
rate was given to build up a new industry in the West.
In other words, the cost of service, a dependable guide for a
road in a static condition, failed of effect upon a line possessed
of great dynamic possibilities. Occasionally opposition of
principles like this may occur in questions of classification. It
may temporarily be worth while, in order to build up a new
industry, to accord a lower rating to a commodity actually
more valuable or more expensive to handle than others. Here
again the dynamic force in the value of service principle out-weighs
all other considerations of relative cost of service.</p>

<p>The value of service principle in general fails, not only in
the determination of absolutely reasonable rates, but it is inadequate
also to the solution of perhaps the more difficult
problem of relative rates. This question of relativity is twofold;
first as between different places, and secondly as between
different commodities. These are, in other words, the problems
respectively of distance tariffs and of classification. The
manner in which distance tariffs evolve, has already been dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>cussed,
and it is evident that the cost of service principle is of
fundamental importance, even though it be tempered by considerations
of commercial expediency, that is to say, by the
necessity of at all times under stress of competition, charging
only what the traffic will bear. But while the value of service
principle&mdash;charging according to demand in other words&mdash;applies
at the competitive points, the other principle of relative
cost should be the fundamental one in fixing upon the scale
of local non-competitive rates.</p>

<p>The second phase of the problem of relativity arises in connection
with classification.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> How shall goods be graded in respect
of their freight charges for identical services in carriage?
Besides illustrating the interplay of the two fundamental
principles, this topic serves also to clear up another possible
confusion of terms. Proportioning transportation charges to
the value of the service must always be clearly distinguished
from basing them upon the mere value of the goods. Nothing
is more certain than that no direct causal relation between
freight rates and the intrinsic value of commodities is traceable.
On wire the freight rate between two given points may be
about one-fourth of the commercial value; on sheet iron one-third;
on lumber somewhat more, and on hay two-fifths;
while on cattle and hogs the freight rate may range as low as
one-tenth to one-eighth of their commercial value. On coal,
on the other hand, the freight rate often more than equals the
price of the coal at the mine, and on very low grade commodities
like bricks, the transportation charges may equal two or
even three times the worth of the goods.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> For each locality or
even direction, these percentages will change. Positive reasons
for these varying relationships are discernible in local trade
conditions. While in general cheap goods are rated lower;
if for any reason&mdash;bulkiness or risk&mdash;they cost relatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>more to transport, they may very properly be advanced in
grade. Normally, raw products move at lower rates than finished
products&mdash;for instance, wheat and flour or cattle and
beef. This is in accord with charging what the traffic will
bear in relation to value. But in the making of export rates,
it may be to the interest of the carrier to reverse this order,
actually according to the finished product the lower rate,
thereby encouraging the development of manufactures at home
rather than abroad.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Classification committees and regulative
commissions are thus compelled to waver between the two
opposing considerations of cost and value. One cannot avoid
the conclusion, however, that, contrary to the usual rule, in
this field of classification undue weight is often accorded by
railway managers to that small element of total cost of service
arising from risks of damage in transit&mdash;insurance cost, in
other words&mdash;to the neglect of the financially more important
consideration of what the traffic will bear. This emphasis
upon the cost side of the account by classification committees,
oddly enough is peculiarly characteristic of ratings in the higher
class commodities. Among low grade goods, like grain, lumber
or coal, the risk of damage is small, so that insurance cost
becomes almost negligible. The insistent consideration among
these low grade commodities is much more apt to be that of
relative demand; arising from the necessity of close and constant
adjustment to the behests of trade. Special or commodity rates,
based directly upon what the traffic will bear, rather than upon
the element of cost, are likely to prevail in these cases. But
the very large revenue which could be obtained from increasing
the rates upon the higher grade of goods seems not to be
fully appreciated.</p>

<p>A valuable instance of the play of opposing considerations
of cost and value of service in the classification of freight rates
is afforded by the complaint in 1908 of the pulp paper makers
in Wisconsin, already cited in another connection.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> It appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>that for similar service over the same roads, the rates per
carload on saw logs for lumber were only about one-half those
charged for carriage of logs to be ground into paper pulp.
Judged on the basis of commercial value, hemlock and spruce
bolts, too short and often otherwise unfit for lumber, were
worth much less than saw logs; and yet they paid double the
freight rates. This was not because the pulp wood was less
desirable as traffic. In many ways it was more so. The
haul was twice as long as for saw logs. The paper mills brought
relatively more supplementary tonnage in the form of coal,
food stuffs and supplies for workmen and their families. Fully
as much of the finished product to be reshipped to consumers
resulted. While smaller in volume, the pulp wood business
was far more permanent. It was growing rapidly while the
lumber business was declining. Moreover, the actual cost of
service in hauling pulp wood was fully as low as for lumber
logs. Carloads were much heavier, and were more regular in
movement. In practice they involved no milling-in-transit
obligation, that is to say, no obligation to re-ship the finished
paper out over the same road; while all the saw log rates carried
this obligation&mdash;a matter of some moment to the railways.
And finally the value of the service to shippers of pulp wood
was less than to mere lumbermen; in other words, the paper
makers were operating under closer margins of profit; their
plants were more costly, and depreciated more rapidly. The
defence of the carriers in this case was not that the rates on
pulp wood were too high in themselves, but that the rate on
saw logs was perhaps unduly low&mdash;the latter having been
crowded down to a minimum figure by competition in the
early days of the business by the lumber raftsmen who floated
the saw logs downstream from the forest to the saw mills.
But of equal importance probably in perpetuating the higher
rates on pulp logs, was the assumption that while the value of
the bolts themselves was perhaps even less than that of saw
logs, the value of the resultant product, paper, was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
greater than that of lumber. But the Wisconsin Railroad
Commission, in entire harmony with the principle repeatedly
laid down by the Federal commission, held that the carriers
must be guided by real distinctions of cost from a transportation
standpoint and not by gradations of value. If the goods
were bulky, awkward, or risky to handle, perhaps requiring
special appliances or equipment, relatively high classification
was permissible. But if they were substantially similar for
purposes of carriage, no gradation in rates based upon differences
in the ultimate uses to which the commodity might be
put would be upheld. Such was the reasoning of the Interstate
Commerce Commission in a decision, holding that fire,
building and paving brick must be accorded equal rates, regardless
of their differing values.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> That the element of value
is, however, not negligible is brought out in a later Federal
case,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> wherein it was recommended that cheap china, to be
given away as premiums in the tea trade, be rated nearer
ordinary crockery or earthenware, even though shipped in the
same manner as high grade china ware. Under the official
classification, chinaware is rated first class if in boxes, and
second class in casks. Earthenware or crockery is carried at
twenty per cent, less than third class, in small packages (<span class="smcap">L. C. L.</span>).
On the basis of mere cost of service, it would seem as if boxes
of chinaware should have a lower rating than casks. Boxes
stow better than casks, with less risk of breakage. But the
commercial practice being to ship the finer grades of chinaware
in boxes, such shipments are graded higher because the
traffic will usually bear a higher rate. Thus considerations of
cost of service yield to those of value. The Interstate Commerce
Commission, however, noting the exceptional circumstances
under which the tea company distributed its cheap
chinaware, recommended a revision of the classification to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>meet the needs of the case; in other words ordering a greater
emphasis upon the elements of the value of the service, even at
the expense of relative cost of operation.</p>

<p>Our final conclusion, then, must be this: That both principles
are of equal importance; and that both must be continually
invoked as a check upon each other. The tendency to the
elevation of cost of service to a position of priority&mdash;rather
characteristic of regulative bodies and of legislators&mdash;is no less
erroneous than the marked disposition of railway managers to
insist upon the universal applicability of the principle of charging
what the traffic will bear. Neither will stand the test of
reasonableness alone. Whether the one or the other should
take precedence can only be determined by a careful study
of the circumstance and conditions in each case; and in practice,
the instances where either principle becomes of binding
effect to the entire exclusion of the other, are extremely rare.</p>

<p>The philosophy of rebating has perhaps never been better
described than in the following quotation from the Cullom
Committee investigation of 1886:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Wicker</span>. I am speaking now of when I was a railroad man.
Here is quite a grain point in Iowa, where there are five or six elevators.
As a railroad man, I would try and hold all those dealers on a 'level
keel,' and give them all the same tariff rate. But suppose there was
a road five or six or eight miles across the country, and those dealers
should begin to drop in on me every day or two and tell me that that
road across the country was reaching within a mile or two of our
station and drawing to itself all the grain. You might say that it
would be the just and right thing to do to give all the five or six dealers
at this station a special rate to meet that competition through the
country. But, as a railroad man, I can accomplish the purpose better
by picking out one good, smart, live man, and, giving him a concession
of three or four cents a hundred, let him go there and scoop the business.
I would get the tonnage, and that is what I want. But if I give it to
the five it is known in a very short time. I can illustrate that better
by a story told by Mr. Vanderbilt when he and his broker had a deal
in stocks. The broker came in and said, 'Mr. Vanderbilt, I would
like to take in my friend John Smith.' Mr. Vanderbilt said, 'Let us
see how this will work. Here are you and myself in this deal now.
We take in John Smith; that makes a hundred and eleven. I guess
I won't do it.' When you take in these people at the station on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
private rebate you might as well make it public and lose what you
intend to accomplish. You can take hold of one man and build him
up at the expense of the others, and the railroad will get the tonnage."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Senator Harris.</span> The effect is to build that one man up and
destroy the others?"</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Wicker</span>. Yes, sir; but it accomplishes the purposes of the
road better than to build up the six."</p></div>

<p>The force of this description of the underlying motive for
personal discrimination, so far as the carrier is concerned;
namely to build up one man at the expense of his competitors
and to attach him in interest indissolubly to the company, is
well exemplified in a case which occurred in 1908 at Galveston,
Texas.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Practically all railway traffic entering Galveston was
destined for export. Wharfage facilities were limited to two
concerns, one of them being the Southern Pacific Terminal
Co. A uniform charge of one cent per hundredweight for
cotton seed meal and cake passing over the wharves of both
companies had been the rule for a long time. Yet it appeared
on complaint that one merchant had been granted wharfage
space under discriminatingly favorable conditions. Exemption
from demurrage charges, free storage room and other favors
and a fixed rental of $15,000 per year irrespective of the
amount of his shipments, had enabled him, having been in
business only since 1898, to build up a very large traffic. The
export of cotton seed cake instead of meal had greatly increased
since 1904. The business of all other competitors since
this contract was made had shrunk to insignificant proportions
by comparison with that done by this favored merchant. The
margin of profit in the business was so small that the difference
between the charges and privileges enjoyed by this individual
and his competitors, was forcing them all out of business. It
was estimated by the Interstate Commerce Commission that if
the customary wharfage charges had been paid, the rental
would have been nearly $30,000 for the year 1907, irrespective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>of other favors. The cotton planters complained also that this
monopoly limited their market and depressed business. It is
clear that the larger the business, that is to say the more nearly
it became a monopoly, the smaller became the wharfage charges
per hundredweight under this system of a fixed rental; and, in
consequence, the greater was the disability of the other shippers.
The advantage to the railroad appeared in a contract
entered into, which provided that all traffic for this individual
should be routed over the Southern Pacific or its connecting
lines. As he had practically gathered in all the cotton seed
export business of Texas and the adjoining states within two
years, it is evident that this consideration was of great value
to the railroad. The economic motive in this case and in
the one previously cited was the same. It will be found
in fact to underlie almost all cases of personal favoritism and
discrimination.</p>

<p>The supreme disadvantage in building up a great monopoly
in order to win traffic for a railroad is, of course, that the moment
the shipper becomes sufficiently powerful, he can play
off one road against another, thus becoming practically master
of the situation. Sindbad is soon overwhelmed by the old
man of the sea. And the weaker the road financially, the more
powerful is the appeal, to which at last even the strongest lines
must succumb. The history of the Standard Oil Company during
the eighties clearly exemplifies this. The rapid rise of the
cattle "eveners" yet earlier, until, as the private refrigerator
car companies they controlled the situation, was primarily
traceable to the same causes. The late J. W. Midgly<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> gives
a forcible illustration in the attempt in 1894 of ninety-five
railroads to reduce the mileage allowance paid for use of oil
tank cars owned by private companies from three-fourths to
one-half cent per mile, loaded and empty. The Union Tank
Line promptly replied that it would in that event at once concentrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>all its vast tonnage to points north and west of Chicago,
upon the single line&mdash;presumably the weakest one&mdash;which
would continue the old rate. This argument was irresistible;
and in the old days of unregulated competition was in the
nature of things bound to be so.</p>

<p>Careful distinction must be made at this point, between
personal discrimination and general rate cutting. Rebating,&mdash;that
is to say, departure from published tariffs,&mdash;occurs in both
cases. The difference between the two is that in the one case
it is special, particular and secret; while in the other it is so
general, if not indeed universal, as to be matter of common
knowledge. Rebating, in other words, is a common feature of
rate wars. But, on the other hand, general harmony in the
rate situation by no means implies the absence of personal
favoritism. During a wide-open rate war, indeed, the most
iniquitous aspect of rebating,&mdash;inequality of treatment as
between rival shippers,&mdash;may be quite absent. All may be
getting the same rate, namely a cut rate; although the chances
are of course that the bigger the shipper, the more substantial
the concessions offered. It is important to keep this distinction
clear, especially since the railways have awakened to the losses
to themselves attendant upon rate wars.</p>

<p>All parties concerned are probably agreed in the hope of
eliminating the rate war forever. But there is not the same
evidence of either an intent or desire on the part of railway
officials to get rid of what, from a public point of view, is even
more insidious and unjust; that is to say, the secret concession
of favors to a few chosen large shippers. General rate wars,
as will later appear, are probably a thing of the past.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But
secret rebating seems, on the other hand, to be an evil which
must be combatted vigorously and un-intermittently in order
to uproot it as a feature of American industrial life. And of
course it must cease. For it is the most prolific source of evil
known in transportation. It has probably had more to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>with the creation of great industrial monopolies than any other
single factor. The first feature of any reform of our intolerable
"trust" situation, must be to keep the rails open on absolutely
even terms to all shippers, large or small.</p>

<p>The keynote of discrimination is, as we have said, the
creation of monopoly, or, at all events, of so large an
aggregation of shipments, that a profitable partnership between
the shipper and the railroad results. This is clear
in recent indictments which charge that the railroads concerned,
having selected one large firm of forwarders in New
York and Chicago are giving them a monopoly in respect
of all imports. In the case of the great beef packers, the
railroad having once built up a shipper by favored rates,
may continue in the enjoyment of this concentrated tonnage
with greater security and profit than if it moved in
a multitude of small shipments by numerous competitors. Of
course there is another less common form of rebating which,
so far as its profit is concerned, is limited to the particular
dishonest railway official who arranges the matter. Such
favoritism as this, however, represents a loss to the company;
and has always been stamped out by the carriers when discovered.
The principal form above described, is much more
difficult to uproot. And yet for some reason, it is a distinctively
American abuse. European countries seem never to have
suffered from it, to any such degree as has the United States.
It is, as has just been said, perhaps the most iniquitous, the most
persistent and until very recently the most nearly ineradicable
evil connected with the great business of transportation.</p>

<p>Rebating in the early days consisted in simply refunding
by direct payment to the favored shipper, a certain proportion
of the freight bill. This refund might be in cash, in presents to
himself or his family, in salary allowances to clerks, in free
passes, or in free transportation of other goods. In a recent
case in New York it has taken the form of importer's
"commissions." But, since 1887 at least, an inconvenience in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
all such transactions is their necessary entry in some form or
other upon the books of the company. Of course such rebates
could be covered up as a fictitious charge to operating expenses;
or, as in the case of the Atchison in 1893, might be carried as
an asset, as if such refunds would ever be paid. Nearly $4,000,000
was thus entered as padding in Atchison assets, when it
went into a receiver's hands at that time.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Much of the flagrant
Standard Oil rebating in the eighties was almost openly,
and certainly boldly, carried on by these means. But public
sentiment was always against it; and of course, it was a breach
of good faith as between the railways themselves, in their
endeavor to maintain agreed rates. Secrecy, therefore, always
attaches to these transactions; and the most ingenious devices
were invented to confer favors without detection.</p>

<p>Underclassification of freight was a very common device
in the old days. It has reappeared again since 1907 in much
the same form. There is a great difference between the freight
on a keg of nails and of fine brass hardware or cutlery. Who
is to know whether a shipment be billed as one or the other?
Is every box of dry goods to be examined in order to discover
whether it contains silks or the cheapest cotton cloth? A carload
of lumber or cordwood might easily by prearrangement
be filled inside with high grade package freight. The utmost
vigilance is in fact necessary on the part of carriers, to prevent
such fraudulent practices by shippers. Under the Joint Rate
Trunk Line Inspection Bureau in 1893, 183,575 such false
descriptions or underweighings were detected on westbound
shipments from seaboard cities alone.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> What the amount
of such Underclassification of freight by collusion between
agent and shipper was, can only be conjectured. Even more
difficult to detect was the practice of under-billing.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> At a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>time, the rate on flour from Minneapolis to New York was
thirty cents per hundredweight, divided between connecting
roads in the proportion of ten cents from Minneapolis to
Chicago, and twenty cents from there on to destination. In
the meantime, as against this ten cent proportion of the through
rate to New York, the local rate from Minneapolis to Chicago
was twelve and one-half cents. As between two rival shippers,
the one sending to Chicago on a New York through rate
instead of a local one, would enjoy a clear advantage of twenty-five
per cent. over his competitor. And who was to know
whether a car billed through to New York, was really going
beyond Chicago or not? In one period of three months,
1098 cars thus through billed to New York were turned over
at Chicago to a belt line road; and only 468 actually went on
to that destination. About sixty per cent. of the traffic was
being rebated by this means. Very complicated arrangements
of this sort were rife in the Missouri river rate wars on grain in
1896. This was known as the "expense-bill" system; or
"carrying at the balance of the through rate."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Many services or facilities are worth as much to a merchant
as a direct refund in cash. He may be given free cartage.
This was a very common expedient in the early days; being
fully considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Or free storage on wheels or in freight houses may be utilized
as a cover for favoritism. A low carload rate might be given,
and then the goods be held, storage free, by the railway at
some central point; to be subsequently delivered piecemeal
as sold. The dealer would be relieved of all expense for warehousing
as well as of high less-than-carload rates from the
initial point of shipment. The competitor who paid the less-than-carload
rate on an equal volume of business would be
sadly handicapped. Cases are on record where fish was thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>stored free from November to February, being reshipped on
order in small lots. Or an excessive allowance might be made
by the railway for some service or facility afforded by the shipper.
The beef interests first got their hold upon the carriers
by demanding liberal rebates in return for acting as "eveners"
in the partition of traffic between the trunk lines about 1873.
Complaint against excessive allowances to favored grain elevator
owners, was common all through the West for years. The
elevator allowance cases before the Interstate Commerce
Commission in 1906-1910 concerning practices on the Union
Pacific lines illustrate the delicacy of the issues involved.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Deductions from the full tariff for the use of special equipment
owned by shippers, has been one of the commonest
means of building up great monopolies.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The allowances to
the Standard Oil Company for the use of its tank cars, before
the construction of pipe lines, and especially prior to 1888, were
a source of great unrest.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> But the construction of pipe lines
has not lessened their importance. It is on record that the use
of private cars in other lines of business has led to grave abuses.
When stock cars and beef refrigerator cars, owned by private
shippers, first began to be used about 1883-1884, they were
much sought after by the railroads as traffic. They moved
regularly, not by seasons; the volume of business was large
and rapidly growing; it was concentrated at a few large initial
points; much of it was high class and very remunerative.
With the enormous extension of refrigeration to cover the long-distance
movement of fruit and vegetables, a still more powerful
encouragement came into play. These latter businesses
were highly seasonal. Few roads could afford to maintain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>highly specialized equipment to care for a business of a few
weeks length. But a private company operating all over the
country, could utilize its cars first for early vegetables and
fruits from the south, then from the middle west or the Oregon-Washington
region, and finally in winter for oranges from California
or Florida. The number of these cars rapidly increased
until by 1903 there were 130,000 in service,&mdash;in fact about
one-eleventh of all the freight cars in the United States were
privately owned. The so-called Armour interests, primarily
engaged in the packing business, were by far the largest single
concern.</p>

<p>The system of payment for the use of these cars consisted
of an allowance, based upon the mileage performed. This
used to be one cent per mile, loaded and empty, for refrigerator
cars. In 1894 a determined effort was made by the carriers to
reduce this below the point then reached of three-fourths of a
cent per mile. But the extraordinary concentration both of
ownership and traffic, rendered it easy for the car companies to
defeat the proposition. In the meantime the steady increase
in volume of traffic, making whole trainloads possible, together
with the growth of very long distance business, made it imperative
that these trains be operated at high speed with few
stops. This at once enormously enhanced the earning power
of each car, as based upon mileage. The performance was
often as high as four times that of the ordinary freight
cars.</p>

<p>Under these new conditions, at the current rate of earnings,
a car would pay for itself in three years, besides paying all expenses
of maintenance. The burden of these allowances became
very great. The situation some years ago is well described
by a former member of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Investigations made by the Interstate Commerce Commission
at different times have disclosed to some extent the very large sums
received by shippers as mileage for the use of such cars.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<p>"By an investigation made in 1889 it appeared that on a single
line of road between Chicago and an interior Eastern point&mdash;a distance
of 470 miles&mdash;refrigerator cars owned by three shipping firms
made in nine months, from August 1, 1888, to May 1889, 7,428,406
miles, and earned for mileage $72,945.97, being about $8,112 a month
or substantially at the rate of $100,000 a year.</p>

<p>"By another investigation, made in 1890, it appeared that private
stock cars to the number of 250 had been used upon a line made up of
two connecting roads between Chicago and New York, beginning with
150 cars on September 1, 1880, increased 30 more a month later, 20
more another month later, and reaching the total of 250 in June, 1890;
that the cars altogether had cost $156,500, and had earned for mileage
in two years, from September 1, 1888, to September 1, 1890, $205,582.68;
that the entire expense to be deducted during that period for car
repairs and salaries for their management was $34,050.48, leaving net
revenue to the amount of $171,532.20, being an excess of $15,032 above
the whole cost of the cars. The cars were, therefore, paid for and a
margin besides in two years, and, thereafter, under the same management
and with a corresponding use of the cars, an income of upward
of $100,000 a year was assured on an investment fully repaid, or, in
effect, on no investment whatever."</p></div>

<p>By 1903 the railroads were paying over $12,000,000 annually
for the use of such equipment.</p>

<p>With the growth of their power, the extortionate demands
of these private car lines, both upon the railroads and the
shipper, steadily enlarged. From the roads they often compelled
fictitious mileage allowances; and from the shipper the
most outrageous charges were made for icing and other services
en route. The reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission
for 1903-1904 and of the Senate (Elkins) Committee of 1905
deal fully with these abuses. Moreover the Armour company
gradually forced other competitors out of business, and with
the growth of monopoly, its exactions became even more
extreme. The following instance is typical.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In 1898 the Armour Car Lines Company was furnishing cars for
the movement of Michigan fruits from points on the Pere Marquette
Railroad to Boston in competition with other private car companies,
and its charge for refrigeration to Boston was $20 per car. Its present
charge to Boston is $55 per car. Before the present exclusive contract
was entered into between the Armour Car Lines and the Pere Marquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Railroad Company the actual quantity of ice required was charged for
at $2.50 per ton. Under this system the cost of refrigerating cars from
Pawpaw, Mich., to Dubuque, Iowa, averaged about $10 per car, while
the present schedule of the Armour Car Lines is $37.50. The cost of
icing from Mattawan, Mich., to Duluth was $7.50, as shown by an
actual transaction in the year 1902, while the present refrigeration
charge between those points is $45. The cost of icing pineapples from
Mobile to Cincinnati under an exclusive contract with the Armour Car
Lines is $45, while the cost of performing the same service from New
Orleans to Cincinnati over the Illinois Central is $12.50 per car."</p></div>

<p>Fortunately the progressive enlargement of Federal powers of
supervision has tended to check these exactions. But the
system of special allowances for the use of privately owned
equipment, is one which needs the most careful watching by
the authorities.</p>

<p>With the passage of time, and especially since 1896, new
and even more elaborate schemes for rebating have come to
light. One of the most ingenious, which was discovered about
1904 to be very widespread, was the use of terminal or spur
track railway companies.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In Hutchinson, Kansas, for example,
were salt works having a capacity of some 6000 barrels a
day. Two railways were available for shipments. A new
company was incorporated, all its stock being held by the salt
works owners, which constructed sidings to both railroad lines.
The spur track was less than a mile long and cost only about
$8000 to build. But the company was chartered as the Hutchinson
and Arkansas River Railroad. Its officers were the owners
of the salt mills. It owned neither engines nor cars. Yet it
entered into a traffic agreement with the Atchison road for a
division of the through rate to many important points, its
share being about twenty-five per cent. So substantial a pro-rate
was this, that in a few months the H. and A. R. R. received
back some fifteen thousand dollars as its share of the through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>freight rates. And every dividend declared by it was, of
course in effect a rebate enjoyed exclusively by this particular
mill, as against less favored competitors.</p>

<p>Obviously, rebates assuming the above-described form are
open only to very large shippers, to whom it is worth while to
incur the considerable expense. But many concerns have
already such trackage in or about their works. Nothing is
needed except to incorporate them separately, and then to enter
into suitable traffic agreements with standard roads. Many of
the so-called trusts were implicated in such transactions, about
1904-1905. The International Harvester Company at Chicago
had for years performed much of its own terminal service; and
until 1904 was allowed as high as $3.50 per car for switching
charges by connecting railroads. It then incorporated the
Illinois Northern Railroad, which was promptly conceded
twenty per cent, of all through rates, with the Missouri river
rate as a maximum. On this traffic it would be allowed as
high as $12 per car, instead of $3.50 as before. The Illinois
Steel Company afforded in 1905 an even more flagrant example.
Apparently it had enjoyed extra-liberal proportions of through
rates since 1897, by means of its separately incorporated and,
in fact, really important terminal road. But an allowance of
$700 to $1000 for hauling a trainload of coke some seven miles,
yielded a profit on the business of perhaps ninety per cent.
It was an advantage which no competitor could hope to equal.
No doubt the practice of switching allowances was properly
used at the start. But the large crop of cases discovered in
1904-1905 proved that they had come to be very widely used
as a cover for rebating. It is not always easy, however, to
decide when such an allowance ought to be made to a privately
owned terminal company. The Anheuser-Busch case, decided
in June, 1911, with a dissenting opinion by Commissioner Harlan,
shows how intricately involved such issues may become.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The so-called "midnight tariff" was a strictly legal way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
conferring favors upon certain shippers. It was much in evidence
during the grain wars between lines serving the Gulf
ports about 1903. And it seems to have been a device used at
times all over the country. A traffic manager wishing to steal
all the business of a large shipper from some competing road,
and to build him up at the expense of his rivals, secretly agrees
to put into effect a low rate on a given date. The shipper then
enters into contracts calling for perhaps several hundred carloads
of grain to be delivered at that time. This reduction is
publicly filed, perhaps thirty days in advance, with the Interstate
Commerce Commission at Washington. But who is to
discover it, in the great medley of new tariffs placed on file
every day? Yet this is not all. A second tariff, restoring the
full rate, is also filed to take effect very shortly,&mdash;perhaps only
a day,&mdash;after the reduction occurs. All these are public, and
open to all shippers alike. But only the one who was forewarned
is able to take advantage of them. He rushes all his
shipments forward while the reduced rates are in effect. Before
other competitors can assemble their grain or other goods, the
brief reduction has come to an end; and rates are restored to
their former figure.</p>

<p>The President of the Chicago Great Western Railway has
concisely described the commercial effect of one of these midnight
tariffs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A clean profit, he says, over all expenses of one half of a cent
per bushel is a satisfactory profit to the middleman; and a guaranteed
rate of transportation of even so small a sum as one-quarter of a cent
per bushel less than any other middleman can get, will give the man
possessing it a monopoly of the business of handling the corn in the
district covered by the guaranty. Why? Such are the facilities of
trade by means of bills of lading, drafts, telegraphs, banks, etc., that
to do an enormous corn trade, the middleman requires only a comparatively
small capital to use as a margin. A capital of $50,000 is ample
thus to handle 15,000,000 bushels, and with activity, double that
amount, per annum. One quarter of a cent per bushel profit on 15,000,000
bushels would amount to $37,500 which is equal to .75 per cent.
per annum on the capital employed."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar device was used by the Burlington road in its dealings
with the Missouri river packing houses on export traffic. They
signed an agreement making a rate to Germany of twenty-three
cents per hundred to last until December 31, 1905. Before the
expiration of this time, however, the roads concerned, publicly
filed an amended tariff presumably for all shippers of thirty-five
cents per hundred. They nevertheless continued the old rate
to the packers. This case went to the Supreme Court which decided
in 1908 that the device was unlawful and discriminatory.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>And then again there are all the possibilities of the printer's
art to be used, in connection with the preparation of elaborate
tariffs.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The tariff of "33 cents per hundredweight" may
conceivably be a typographical error, to be speedily corrected
in a supplementary hektograph sheet filed the next day. Involved
and elaborate rate sheets may be reprinted with only
one little change among a thousand items left as before. Different
tariffs may interlock with complicated cross references.
In one case in 1902 it took seven different tariffs to enable one
to compute the rate for a given shipment. In twelve months,
to December 1907, there were filed with the Interstate Commerce
Commission 220,982 such tariffs, each containing changes
in rates or rules. Some "expire with this shipment,"&mdash;and
some agree to "protect" any rate of any competing carrier,
that is to say, to meet it if it happen to be lower.</p>

<p>An entirely different plan of rebating,&mdash;and a most effective
one,&mdash;has to do with apparently unrelated commercial
transactions.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Many shippers are large sellers of supplies to
the railroad. How easy then to make a concession in rates to
an oil refinery for example, by paying a little extra for the lubricating
oil bought from a subsidiary concern. The Federal
authorities in recent years and especially in connection with
the prosecution of the Standard Oil Company in 1908-1911,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>have discovered the most extraordinary variations in the prices
paid by railroads for supplies. Independent concerns were
often not allowed to compete in the sale of lubricants at all.
It would be difficult to prove any connection between so widely
separate sets of dealings; and yet it is clear that rebates are
often given in this way. Or even more fruitful as an expedient,
especially in these later days when rebating is a serious offence,
why not confer a favor by extra liberality in allowances for
damages to goods in transit? In 1909 the so-called Beef Trust
was specifically ordered by the Attorney General of the United
States to desist from such practices. Positively the only way
to detect such fictitious allowances for damages, is to ferret out
each case by itself. This is a slow and necessarily expensive
process. Damage allowances and <i>quid pro quo</i> transactions
in the purchase of supplies, are indeed almost "smokeless
rebates," as they have aptly been termed.</p>

<p>Personal discrimination may be as effective upon competition
through denial of facilities to some shippers, as through
conferring of special favors upon others. Practices of this
sort have been quite common in the coal business, especially
in the matter of furnishing or refusing to furnish an ample supply
of cars or suitable spur tracks to mines. In the well known
Red Rock Fuel Company case in 1905,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the railroad definitely
announced its policy, "not to have a lot of little shippers on its
line who would ship coal when prices were high and then shut
up shop and go home and let the large shippers have the lean
years." The development of over 4,000 acres of coal lands
was thus denied in favor of the large companies, until the
Interstate Commerce Commission took the matter up. A
year later came the startling revelations upon the Pennsylvania
Railroad as to the practice of discrimination in furnishing cars
to coal mines.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> A comprehensive investigation by the company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>itself resulted in the discharge of a number of high officials.
It appeared, for example, that the assistant to President Cassatt
had acquired $307,000 in stock of coal companies without cost;
that a trainmaster for $500 had purchased coal mine stock
which yielded an annual income of $30,000; and that one road
foreman was given three hundred shares of the same company
stock for nothing. In all these cases the object was to secure
not only an ample supply of cars for the favored companies,
but perhaps even the denial of suitable service to troublesome
competitors. In this regard, the old practices of the Standard
Oil Company in the eighties are recalled. Not only, as in
the celebrated Rice case,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> did it demand heavy refunds on its
own shipments, but it also compelled the imposition of a surtax
on its competitors' traffic which was to be added to its own
special allowance.</p>

<p>Yet other means of favoring large shippers at the expense
of small ones, are almost impossible to eradicate. Certain of
these may be illustrated by recently discovered practices of
the Standard Oil Company. They are fully described in a
special report of the United States Commissioner of Corporations
in 1905. Upon the basis of this evidence, extraordinary
efforts were made by the Federal authorities to secure convictions
and to impose heavy fines for violation of the Elkins
law. But the company escaped heavy penalties, in the main,
by reason of legal technicalities. The prosecutions of 1906-1909,
however, cannot be regarded as valueless, merely because
the company escaped the imposition of fines aggregating millions
of dollars. The moral effect of it was thoroughly good;
and it is now clear that laws can be so drawn as to apply in
future. Nor can any student of the evidence doubt for a moment,
that, whether strictly an infraction of the law or not,
the net result of these practices was to confer an advantage
upon this large shipper, not open to its smaller competitors.
Certain of its advantages, such as the ownership of pipe lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
from the wells to the seaboard refineries and the strategic
location of its plants, are the fruit of great resources and keen
business acumen. But other advantages, particularly the
relative rates on refined oil from Standard Oil plants and from
centres of independent refining, are, according to the report of
the Bureau of Corporations, due to pressure brought to bear
upon the carriers. Whether they are or not, the result is
discriminatory just the same.</p>

<p>The reason for the persistent pressure for low rates on
petroleum products is, of course, that the cost of manufacture
is so low relatively to the expense of transportation. An
ample manufacturing profit is one-half cent per gallon of crude
oil; and the average cost of refining does not exceed that
amount. Yet a half cent will scarcely pay freight for more
than one hundred miles. Hence it follows that for distances
greater than this, the question of profit or loss may entirely
depend upon the delicate adjustment of the freight rate. In
this regard, a great company shipping all over the country
has a great advantage over smaller competitors with a strictly
local market, in that it can play off one rate against another.
Thus, in one notable case, cited by the Bureau of Corporations,
the Burlington road gave an absolutely unremunerative rate
from the Standard refinery at Whiting near Chicago to East
St. Louis, thereby enabling troublesome competition to be
subdued; but it was recompensed by the payment of heavier
charges on shipments to other points on the Burlington system,
where, there being no competition, the high freight rate could
be shifted on to the consumer. The Commissioner of Corporations
gives one instance on the Northwestern road of a carload
rate from Whiting to Milwaukee in order to meet water
competition from independents at Toledo, which netted the
carrier just ninety-two cents for the carriage of 24,000 pounds
of oil a distance of eighty-five miles, with free return of the
empty car.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of many of these rate adjustments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Standard Oil Company of late years was that they were publicly
filed; and hence not open to legal attack. This does not however
detract in the least from their discriminatory character.
One example, right here in New England, now happily corrected,
may be cited from the records of the Interstate Commerce
Commission for 1906.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The southern half of New England
was mainly supplied with kerosene from the great Standard
refinery at Bayonne, New Jersey. The oil was brought there
from the fields by pipe line; and, being refined, was distributed
by tank vessels all along the coast, with a short rail haul thereafter
to inland points. The total cost to the Standard company
was estimated by the Bureau of Corporations at between
fourteen and sixteen cents per hundredweight. To meet this,
the independent western refiners had to ship all the way by
rail. This was more expensive in any event; but for some
years they found their handicap greatly increased by the
refusal of the New Haven road to join in any joint through
rate. The western independents, therefore, had to pay the
sum of two local rates, up to and beyond the Hudson river,
thereby bringing their transportation up to approximately
thirty cents per hundred pounds. In other words, their cost of
carriage per gallon was enhanced more than enough to constitute
a fair refining profit in itself. The result was the practical
exclusion of competition from this source. Fortunately, however,
after this investigation the New Haven was ordered to
pro-rate with the western roads, thereby overcoming about
half of this disability. This case clearly evinces the necessity
of effective Federal regulation of such matters as joint rates;
and it also shows how possible it may be to so adjust tariffs,
openly and even legally, as to favor one shipper over another.</p>

<p>Unlike the preceding instance, most of the Standard's rebates
have been, in fact if not technically, secret. Perhaps the
most flagrant case occurred in the rates from Whiting to the
southeastern states. The Bureau of Corporations estimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
that $70,000 a year was saved by this device; and all competition
from independent sources was eliminated within that
territory. The Illinois Central and Southern roads cross at an
obscure point in Tennessee known as Grand Junction. This
was made a centre of distribution for the entire South.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> But
the rate under which the oil moved,&mdash;and in one given month
169 carloads were thus carried,&mdash;was given on a special tariff,
publicly filed at Washington, to be sure, but prescribing the rate,
not from Whiting but from Dalton, Illinois, to Grand Junction,
Tennessee. Dalton was an almost unknown station, near the
refinery. Of course any other shipper who happened to know
of it, and who happened to have oil to ship from Dalton to
Grand Junction, could have had the same rate of thirteen cents
a hundred pounds. But he would find it moved over a roundabout
route, over four different connecting lines, instead of over
the rails of a single company. As against this rate of thirteen
cents, the only routes known to the Ohio independent producers
charged from nineteen to twenty-nine and one-half cents per
hundred pounds. Meantime the Standard's oil was by this devious
means reaching every point in the South at prices which
no competitor could hope to meet. In one case, the oil going by
way of Grand Junction, travelled over one thousand miles when
the direct route from Chicago was only a little over five hundred
miles. The adjustment was everywhere such that, even on
the commonly known tariffs, Whiting enjoyed a special advantage
over the sources of independent oil. Atlanta, Georgia, is
only 733 miles by short line and 1003 miles by way of Grand
Junction from Whiting. Toledo, with its independent refineries,
is distant only 687 miles. Yet despite this fact, the commonly
known rates were shown to be, from Whiting, 33.2 cents as
against 47.5 cents from Toledo. So, even without the Grand
Junction contrivance, the Standard was seemingly favored more
than enough. It should be added, in conclusion, that while
the Grand Junction rate was publicly filed, its discriminatory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>character stands proven by the fact that all the actual shipments
were "blind billed;" that is to say, no local agent knew
what was the rate actually paid. Such blind bills of lading
are photographically reproduced in the report above named.
Moreover the ill repute of the transaction was indicated by
the prompt cancellation of the rate when discovered in 1905.
But in the meantime it had done its work, and fixed monopoly
prices for an indispensable product over a quarter of the territory
of the United States.</p>

<p>Aside from the palpably dishonest secret rebating, the real
root of the difficulty with many of the other big shippers beside
the Standard Oil Company,&mdash;and an abuse moreover exceedingly
hard to correct,&mdash;is the open adjustment of rates from
competing centres of manufacture or distribution in such a
way as to confer favors. The Bureau of Corporation's report
on the Transportation of Petroleum Products deals fully with
this. Relative rates, as above stated, always seem to favor
Chicago (Whiting) as against the centres of independent refining
such as Cleveland, Pittsburg, or Toledo. Formerly,
before the great refinery was established in 1890 at Whiting,&mdash;which,
by the way, produces one-third of all the kerosene used
in the United States,&mdash;the roads from these centres made joint
through rates all over the country. They still do so on many
other commodities. But on petroleum products they have
been withdrawn. The result is that everywhere, except where
they can secure entrance by water, the disability in rates
against the independent refiner is most effective. That much
the same conditions prevail in other lines of business is affirmed
on the highest authority. The <i>Railway Age Gazette</i> has repeatedly
protested against the pressure which is now brought
to bear against the carriers by such organizations as the Illinois
Manufacturers' Association to substitute open but discriminatory
local rates for the old secret favors upon which
the great shippers throve for so many years. Fortunately,
however, this situation in some cases relieves the Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
government of the burden of detection of maladjustments of
this sort. For the communities aggrieved are constantly on
the watch to protect their interests against rival cities. This
factor clearly appears in the sugar and cement lighterage cases
in 1908.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Carriers at New York in order to equalize rates with
carriers serving Philadelphia refineries, grant "accessorial
allowances" for the use of lighters or for cartage, in order, as
they aver, to overcome the disability against their clients.
But Philadelphia shippers are ever on the alert to detect such
favors given at New York; and substantially aid the government
in eradicating the evil. In the grain elevator allowance
cases, likewise, at Omaha and Council Bluffs in 1906-1909,
not only unfavored shippers at these points but St. Louis grain
merchants as a body, intervened as complainants against the
system. The powerful motive of self-interest thus invoked is
of great service.</p>

<p>Before dismissing these recent and widely "muck-raked"
oil cases, it may not be out of place to mention the new interpretation
of the Elkins law which has resulted therefrom.
One concerns the definition of separate offences. In the notorious
$29,000,000 fine case, the Federal Circuit judge applied
the maximum penalty of $20,000 for each offence to each
separate carload in a large aggregate of shipments. On review
of the case, each separate settlement of freight rates was defined
as the unit of an offence. As entire train loads had been
forwarded or paid for at one time, this materially reduced the
aggregate of possible penalties. And, in the second place, the
question of legally provable intent was raised. The turning
point in the $29,000,000 fine case, was the ruling of the judge
on review, that it was necessary to prove that a standard rate,
higher than the one actually paid, had actually been filed at
Washington; and that the defendant had knowingly accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
a concession from this figure. These points the government
was unable in fact to establish; and this ended the case.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>While general rate cutting has been less common since
1900, partly also because the roads were rapidly forming great
combinations especially in order to eliminate it, subsequent
developments have proved that personal and secret favoritism
to large shippers was still very common. Despite all they
could do to withstand pressure, traffic managers seemed powerless
without the aid of the law. Perhaps the greatest revelation
of the extent of personal rebating was afforded by the
great Wisconsin investigation under the leadership of Governor
La Follette in 1903.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The original purpose of this inquiry was
fiscal; namely, to examine into the subject of railroad taxation.
But its scope speedily widened, and at last skilled accountants
were put into the books of all the railroads traversing
Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The facts elicited by the Wisconsin investigation were startling.
For the years 1897-1903, the direct rebates appearing
in the accounts of the Wisconsin lines alone,&mdash;taking no
account of other forms of rebates such as excessive damage
allowances and the like,&mdash;were $7,000,000. The Chicago
and Northwestern alone had allowed more than half of this
amount. And from what is now known of other forms of
allowance, the total must have been indeed very great. In
one year recently, there was evidence to the effect that rebates
on the New York Central lines amounted to $1,000,000. According
to its own admission, the Michigan Central road, in
1902-1903, made allowances of $586,000. The rebating to the
beef packers, especially on export business during 1902, was
notorious. No wonder the progressive railroad leaders desired
to put an end to this leakage of revenue. And at their request,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>the wise legislation known as the Elkins Amendments to the
Act to Regulate Commerce was passed in 1903.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The Elkins law of 1903 not only came at a time when the
carriers were in need of every cent of revenue to tide over a
hard year, but it also followed demonstration under the test
of judicial procedure, that convictions for rebating were practically
impossible under the old law. To convict for unjust
discrimination it was necessary to show, not merely the allowance
to one favored shipper, but the fact also had to be proved
that no such allowances were made to others on the same sort
of traffic under similar conditions. This could scarcely ever
be done. In fact, during almost twenty years, there had been
less than a score of convictions. Most of the prosecutions had
failed utterly. Both government and carriers pressed for
legislation. This was promptly given in the Act of February
19, 1903. There were four important features of this law.
Railway corporations, not merely individuals as before, were
now made directly liable to prosecution and penalties. The
tariff filed became the lawful standard. The fact that all
shippers got the same low rate was, therefore, no longer a defence.
In the third place, the shipper as well as the carrier
could be held accountable. In other words, accepting as well
as giving rebates, became unlawful. And, finally, jurisdiction
was conferred upon the Federal courts to restrain any departure
from published rates or any "discrimination forbidden by
law" by writ of injunction. This fully legalized a rather doubtful
course of procedure to which the Interstate Commerce
Commission had been compelled to resort as a last weapon in
the rate wars on grain and beef since 1901. It also abolished
the penalty of adjustment; imposing fines instead. But this
action was subsequently rescinded in the law of 1906.</p>

<p>The record of the vigorous prosecutions against rebating
under the Elkins law,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> affords conclusive evidence, not only as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>to the widespread extent of the evil, but as to its identification
with many of the large industrial combinations. The history
of the activities of the Interstate Commerce Commission is
to be found in its file of annual reports. But little seems to
have been done for the first two years; but great activity was
displayed during 1905. The ensuing year was rather notable
by reason of the success in securing convictions. Besides the
Standard Oil cases, there was collected in fines for rebating between
October, 1905, and March, 1907, the sum of $586,000.
Several men were sent to jail, for from three to six months.
Among the trusts implicated were the beef packers, who have
been indefatigable in concocting rebating devices; the tin
plate combination; and, most notable of all, the American
Sugar Refining Company. Nearly $300,000 in fines was imposed
upon this concern alone. The secret allowances in these
cases were most ingeniously arranged. Some were "refund
of terminal charges;" some were "lighterage demurrage;"
some were allowances for damages. Many were paid by
drafts instead of checks so as to preclude identification of
individuals; some were by special bank account; but the sums
involved were very large. Shipments of sugar on which rebates
of four to six cents per hundred were given, amounted within
a relatively brief period to upwards of 70,000,000 pounds on
one line alone. As sugar shipments westbound from New York
constituted nearly one-third of the total tonnage, the importance
of these prosecutions appear. The following quotation
from a letter from an agent of the sugar trust accompanying
a claim for overcharge of $6,866 on shipments of syrup, introduced
in evidence in one of these cases, aptly describes the
situation, both then, now, and always. "We hope to devise
some means to enable us to conduct our freight matters with
the transportation companies satisfactorily even under the
new conditions imposed by the Elkins bill; but there may be
some cases that cannot be taken care of, in the event of which
we will, like all other shippers, have to take our medicine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
look pleasant." The Interstate Commerce Commission reported
as to the conditions in 1908 that "many shippers still
enjoy illegal advantages." Many convictions were, however,
secured. And investigations in California showed the existence
of an extensive system of preferential rates.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> A list of
108 firms was discovered on the Southern Pacific road alone,
who were enjoying "special inside rates" which often aggregated
$50,000 per month. Many of these assumed the form of
refunds upon claims for damages.</p>

<p>Thus the rebate as an evil in transportation, even since
amendment of the law in 1906-1910, while under control, is
still far from being eradicated. Favoritism lurks in every
covert, assuming almost every hue and form. Practices which
outwardly appear to be necessary and legitimate, have been
shown to conceal special favors of a substantial sort. Among
the latest forms, undue extension of credit may be mentioned.
It appeared, for instance, in 1910 that the Hocking Valley Railroad
was favoring the Sunday Creek Coal Company to the
extent of credit for transportation on its books to the amount
of $2,400,000.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Another device which amounted to favoritism
whether so intended or not, has been brought into court upon
prosecution of the so-called Beef Trust. Substantial concessions
in the rate from Kansas City to various foreign countries
prevailed by reason of the fact that long time contracts for
shipments at an established rate continued after a new higher
general tariff had been put into effect. This increase of rates
in general, leaving the trust rates at the old figure, of course
created an undue and unlawful preference.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The chapter
might be further amplified by details concerning "substitution

<p>The extreme subtlety of personal favoritism was recently
brought to light in connection with the selling price of coal in
the little town of Durham, North Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Complaint was
entered that a certain retailer was charging but five dollars a
ton while his competitors were unable to dispose of theirs at a
profit for less than six dollars. The explanation offered, that
this person employing no bookkeeper and, paying no rent, was
enabled to do this because of these savings, proved inadequate.
Investigation developed the fact that no direct preference from
railroads existed, but that there were, nevertheless, various
peculiar features as to division of rates which invited further
examination. Thus, for example, while the Norfolk &amp; Western
received $30.80 for hauling a carload of coal 160 miles,
the Durham &amp; South Carolina Railroad received $24.80 for
hauling the same car one mile. This little railroad was owned
by a lumber company which seemed in effect to have set up
the defendant coal merchant in business. An arrangement
between this little switching road and the Seaboard Air Line,
as well as the Norfolk &amp; Western, also favored the Durham
&amp; Southern. The key to the situation lay in the fact that
the Dukes,&mdash;powerful financial interests controlling the American
Tobacco Company, the Southern Power Company and
large cotton mills,&mdash;also controlled the Durham &amp; Southern
through the lumber company. The Seaboard Air Line,
therefore, when it gave to this little switching road for a twenty-mile
haul, about forty per cent. of its division on through
business, surreptitiously conferred a heavy bonus upon its
little connection. It must have lost money under such a
division of rates. The only conclusion possible is that this
little railroad was specially favored in order to purchase the
goodwill of financiers controlling a large traffic in other lines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>business. The rebate, however, was not given to the American
Tobacco Company, but constituted a comfortable profit "on
the side" for powerful interests in its management.</p>

<p>The elevation cases concerning the legitimacy of a special
payment for unloading grain in private elevators, have been
under dispute for years. Their validity has recently been
affirmed by the Supreme Court in an important decision in
1911.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> This litigation illustrates the difficulty of defining
rebates as an expression of personal favoritism. In 1899, the
Union Pacific Railroad made a contract with Peavey &amp; Company
at Council Bluffs to erect an elevator and to transfer grain
for a charge of one and one-quarter cents a hundred pounds.
This arrangement was objected to by competing railroads on
the ground that it gave compensation to a private concern,
engaged in general grain business for the handling of its own
property. The Union Pacific insisted that the expedient was
necessary and proper as a means for promptly unloading its
cars at Omaha. The Commission, after investigation, sanctioned
the contract. In 1907, the matter again came before
the Commission upon complaint of other railroads competing
with the Union Pacific along the Missouri river. It was alleged
that the continuance of the elevator allowance by the Union
Pacific would virtually compel all other roads to make similar
allowances. Still the Commission adhered to its former conclusion
that undue discrimination did not result. The practice,
however, gradually spread until all the roads at Missouri river
points put in an allowance of three-fourths of one cent as an
elevator charge. This brought forth a complaint from the lines
at St. Louis that traffic was being diverted from that point as a
result; and the Commission, once more considering the matter,
held that the practice was prejudicial to public interest. Conditions,
in fact, had changed, mainly through the increase of
through shipments to the East without transfer at the Missouri
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>river. The Commission, therefore, held that when such transfer
took place, it was for the accommodation of local grain
merchants, who ought to pay for the service rendered. At
this stage of the proceedings, the matter went to the Supreme
Court of the United States upon appeal. The decision finally
upheld the Commission, in holding that the payment of an
elevation allowance was not unlawful, but that if paid to one
elevator, it must be paid to all. The bearing of this case upon
the larger issue, of payments by railroads for special services
rendered by, shippers cannot fail to be of great importance in
the future.</p>

<p>The use of the industrial railroad as a means of preferential
treatment still occasions difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The case is simple where
but one shipper makes use of the terminal plant; but where a
number of shippers may utilize it jointly, it becomes difficult
to draw the line between pro-rating allowances and actual
rebates. The Manufacturers' Railroad Company, with twenty
miles of track, four locomotives and one hundred and ten
employees, serves a considerable manufacturing section in
South St. Louis. A majority of the stock of this terminal
railroad is held by persons controlling the Anheuser-Busch
Brewery. The enormous traffic of this concern, equal to about
one-thirtieth of the total tonnage of St. Louis, is handled over
the line of the Manufacturers' Railway. Almost nine-tenths
of its business consists of shipments of beer; but in 1910
some 5,424 carloads belonging to other patrons moved over its
rails. For this terminal service the Anheuser-Busch Company,
through the Manufacturers' Railway, got a very substantial
allowance for the service rendered. For example, in one month
on ten carloads of beer, the Louisville &amp; Nashville allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>$45 out of a total revenue of $391.60 for moving the traffic
something less than four thousand feet. The disparity is
obvious between this allowance and the balance remaining as
compensation for moving the traffic 477 miles, including three
first-class railroad tolls and terminal charges at the other end.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>A prime difficulty is to determine whether unduly low
commodity rates amount practically to special favors granted
to large shippers. Much evidence recently tends to show that
the trusts enjoy advantages of this sort not extended to other
competitors. The Steel Corporation, through its ownership of
railroads and steamships, certainly has a great advantage over
its rivals.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But other trusts not controlling common carriers
of their own, are also accorded what seem to be unduly low rates
upon their products. Recent evidence before the Interstate
Commerce Commission seems to show that sugar, beef, and
coffee do not bear their proper share of transportation costs.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Copper, the product of a powerful trust, enjoys a lower ton
mile rate than grain,&mdash;a rate, despite its high intrinsic value,
actually below that on soft coal.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The discrimination is too
palpable to be passed over without explanation.</p>

<p>From the survey of rebating and rate wars,&mdash;which latter
of course afford the most favored soil in which personal favoritism
may flourish,&mdash;one cannot avoid the conclusion that a
great improvement in conditions has been brought about.
The strengthened arm of the Federal government has come to
the support of the carriers; and has assisted them to a material
enhancement of their revenues, by putting a stop to serious
leakages in income. But the carriers could undoubtedly do
much on their own account, could they be granted the right
to make traffic agreements, subject always, of course, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>approval and supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Whether Congress will ever permit this, remains to
be seen. The most important result of all this Federal activity
so far, has been the moral stimulus toward fair business
dealing which has been given. Thousands of shippers today,
quite apart from the fear of fines or imprisonment, would disdain
to ask or accept favors which a decade since would have
been regarded as entirely proper. No one can doubt that the
morale of business is distinctly higher than it used to be. Could
such higher standards become universal, the Department of
Justice would be relieved of a substantial part of its present
duties.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<p>Any unreasonable departure from a tariff graded in some
proportion according to distance is known as local discrimination.
It constitutes one of the most difficult and perplexing
problems in transportation. Personal discrimination now
happily having been practically eliminated since the enactment
of the Elkins Amendments to the Act to Regulate Commerce,
this issue of local discrimination under the rehabilitated
long and short haul clause, has recently assumed an added
significance.</p>

<p>A merchant of Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, purchased a
carload of potatoes at Rochester, New York, and had the
freight bill made for a delivery to Philadelphia, because the
freight to Philadelphia was less than it was to Wilkesbarre,
which is 143 miles nearer. He stopped the potatoes at Wilkesbarre,
unloaded them, and paid the freight. A few days later
he received a bill from the Lehigh Valley Company for twelve
dollars additional freight. If the potatoes had gone to Philadelphia,
he would have paid forty-eight dollars freightage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
As they stopped at Wilkesbarre, he had to pay sixty dollars;
that is, twelve dollars for not hauling the carload 143 miles.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>A merchant in Montgomery, Alabama, shipped two carloads
of fruit jars from Crawfordsville, Indiana, to Montgomery.
He shipped them to Mobile and then paid the local
rate from Mobile back, those fruit jars going through Montgomery
on the way out. By having them hauled 350 miles
farther, he saved seventy-five dollars on the two carloads.</p>

<p>On first-class goods, at one time, the rate from Louisville
to Montgomery, was $1.26 per hundredweight. On to
Mobile, 180 miles further south, it was only ninety cents.
In the same territory the rate on kerosene oil from Cincinnati
at times has been three times as much to interior
points as to New Orleans, three times as far. West of the
Missouri river and in the Rocky mountain area similar complaints
are common. Denver, Colorado, pays $1.79 per hundredweight
on cotton piece goods, in small lots, hauled 2,000
miles from Boston; while the rate to San Francisco, 1,400
miles further away, on the same line, is only $1.50. This
discrepancy is even greater in wholesale rates. No carload
rating is given to Denver; while for similar shipments to the
coast the rate is only one dollar per hundredweight. In the
opposite direction, sugar is carried from San Francisco through
Denver to Kansas City for sixty-five cents per hundredweight,
as compared with a rate of one dollar if the sugar is stopped at
Denver. Smaller places in the West afford equally striking
instances. The rate on rope from San Francisco to Independence,
Kansas, is seventy-five cents; while the same goods are
hauled on through Independence, Kansas, much farther, to
Missouri river points for sixty cents per hundred pounds.
Wichita, Kansas, complains that cotton piece goods from New
York by way of Galveston are rated at $1.36; while by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
same route Kansas City, 225 miles longer haul by that
route, the charge is only ninety-three cents. The Southwestern
Lumberman's Association complains,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"that a train of cars of lumber starts from Camden or other common
point in Texas via Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and one
car is dropped off in Oklahoma at 27&frac12; cents per 100 pounds; one each
also at Wichita and Emporia, Kansas, at 27&frac12; cents per 100 pounds;
one at Kansas City at 23 cents, and two cars also set off this same train
at Kansas City, destined for Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, at 23 and
24 cents per 100 pounds, respectively. The balance of this train, now
at Kansas City, runs on to Chicago, and 24 cents per 100 pounds is
the charge then for most of the train which is left there.... Why
should builders of homes in Wichita and Emporia, Kansas, pay higher
freight than builders in Kansas City, Omaha, and Chicago when using
yellow pine from Texas?"<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p></div>

<p>Such instances as these might be multiplied indefinitely.
They are often striking in character. The first impression is
of intolerable abuse. The simplest tenets of justice and fair
dealing appear to be violated. Careful analysis should, however,
always be made before drawing such conclusions. Railroad
practice seldom departs so flagrantly from the fundamental
consideration of cost of service without very substantial economic
justification.</p>

<p>The reasoning underlying local discrimination is admirably
set forth by President Hadley in the following passage from
his <i>Railroad Transportation</i>:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the coast of Delaware, a few years ago, there was a place
which we shall call X, well suited for oyster-growing, but which sent
very few oysters to market, because the railroad rates were so high
as to leave no margin of profit. The local oyster-growers represented
to the railroad that if the rates were brought down to one dollar per
hundred pounds, the business would become profitable and the railroad
could be sure of regular shipments at that price. The railroad
men looked into the matter. They found that the price of oysters in
the Philadelphia market was such that the local oystermen could
pay one dollar per hundred pounds to the railroad and still have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>fair profit left. If the road tried to charge more, it would so cut down
the profit as to leave men no inducement to enter the business. That
is, those oysters would bear a rate of one dollar per hundred, and no
more. Further, the railroad men found that if they could get every
day a carload, or nearly a carload, at this rate, it would more than
cover the expense of hauling an extra car by quick train back and forth
every day, with the incidental expenses of interest and repairs. So they
put the car on, and were disappointed to find that the local oyster-growers
could only furnish oysters enough to fill the car about half
full. The expense to the road of running it half full was almost as
great as of running it full; the income was reduced one-half. They
could not make up by raising the rates, for these were as high as the
traffic would bear. They could not increase their business much by
lowering rates. The difficulty was not with the price charged, but
with the capacity of the local business. It seemed as if this special
service must be abandoned.</p>

<p>"One possibility suggested itself. At some distance beyond X,
the terminus of this railroad, was another oyster-growing place, Y,
which sent its oysters to market by another route. The supply at Y
was very much greater than at X. The people at Y were paying a
dollar a hundred to send their oysters to market. It would hardly
cost twenty cents to send them from Y to X. If, then, the railroad
from X to Philadelphia charged but seventy-five cents a hundred on
oysters which came from Y, it could easily fill its car full. This was
what they did. They then had half a carload of oysters grown at
X, on which they charged a dollar, and half a carload from Y on which
they charged seventy-five cents for exactly the same service.</p>

<p>"Of course there was a grand outcry at X. Their trade was discriminated
against in the worst possible way&mdash;so they said&mdash;and
they complained to the railroad. But the railroad men fell back on
the logic of facts. The points were as follows: 1. A whole carload
at seventy-five cents would not pay expenses of handling and moving.
2. At higher rates than seventy-five cents they could not get a whole
carload, but only half a carload; and half a carload at a dollar rate
(the highest charge the article would bear) would not pay expenses.
Therefore, 3. On any uniform rate for everybody, the road must lose
money, and 4. They would either be compelled to take the oyster
car away altogether, or else get what they could at a dollar, and fill
up at seventy-five cents. There was no escape from this reasoning;
and the oyster men of X chose to pay the higher rate rather than lose
the service altogether."</p></div>

<p>The logic of this oyster case seems convincing in its simplicity.
But it presents more complications than appear at the
outset.</p>

<p>First of all, what is the nature of the competition at the
more distant point which is alleged to "compel" the lower
rate? Is it merely of rival routes or of competing markets?
It will be advisable to keep the two distinct so far as possible.
Under the first heading, competition of routes, the subjoined
sketches represent two possible situations. In both instances,
however, Y, enjoying the lower rate, is more distant from
Philadelphia than X. The difference between the two arises
from the fact that in the one case X is nearer Philadelphia
than Y on a roundabout line; while in the other X is actually
nearer than Y by the shortest direct route. We may safely
assume that the compelling competition alleged at Y as justifying
the lower rate is by rail; as, the commodity being a
marine bivalve, both places presumably enjoy equal facilities
for water carriage. At all events, assuming that we have to
do with competing rail routes alone, what differences obtain
between the two sets of circumstances above sketched? Not
insignificant inequalities in the length or power of the two routes
are implied by the diagrams. They are supposed to represent
substantially different lines, which may, for the purpose of the
argument, be denominated strong, natural, or standard, and
weak, unnatural, or abnormal, respectively, so far as the par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>ticular
traffic in hand is concerned. That this distinction is
not irrelevant, but frequently of determinant force, is shown
by an analysis of concrete cases which have arisen for
adjudication.</p>

<p>This proposition is clear beyond dispute. The actual cost
of service, which fixes an irreducible minimum rate between
Y and Philadelphia, is less on the short line than by the roundabout
one. For either road to accept less than the portion of
the cost traceable to this particular traffic, that is to say, the
extra cost incident to its acceptance, is economically inconceivable.
From this it follows, other conditions being equal,
that the shortest line between Y and Philadelphia rules the rate
in the last instance. This is normally the case. The roundabout
route thereafter merely accepts the rate thus compelled.
To permit the roundabout line to rule the minimum rate would
not only violate a fundamental principle of operation: it would
inevitably lead to chaos. The analogy with cut-throat competition
in business is obvious. It is equally plain that the mere
acceptance of a short line rate by a roundabout road, so long
as this rate is adequate to yield some profit over the extra cost,
while of advantage to some, may not work positive injury to
any one. This condition normally corresponds to the state of
affairs represented by diagram A. The nearer point, X, as
Hadley avers, has no just grievance against Y because the
latter has the good fortune to have a direct service to Philadelphia
at a low rate. For Y to withdraw shipments from the
line via X might even destroy the only chance of X for a market.
It would also deprive Y of whatever benefit it might have
derived from competition either of routes or of facilities. Of
course, we have expressly omitted market competition as a
factor, reserving it for separate treatment. Yet one objection
arises. Normally, the direct line ought to maintain a tariff
conforming in some degree to the distance principle. The
roundabout line can compete at Y only by a violation of it,
unless, indeed, its local tariffs be graded much more gradually.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
In other words, its progression towards the maximum must be
distributed over a much longer line. Even this would, on
Hadley's statement of fact, eliminate X from the Philadelphia
market. Such reduction of local rates upon the roundabout
route would in turn discriminate against places like Z on the
direct line, equally distant with X from Philadelphia. For
the latter places would necessarily be assessed at a higher rate
per ton-mile.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> This would constitute another form of local
discrimination, which will be discussed in due time. There
is, therefore, at best, only a choice of adjustments, either of
which leads to some form of inequality. But, upon the whole,
balancing the evil with the good, the first variant of our oyster
case appears to be best solved by according all shippers at Y
a somewhat lower rate than X enjoys.</p>

<p>Conditions corresponding to diagram A have frequently
given rise to complaints before courts and administrative
tribunals. An interesting illustration is afforded by the Hillsdale
ice case in Michigan.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Ice was moved from this town to
Springfield and Columbus, two neighboring Ohio cities, over
several different routes. (See map on next page.) To Columbus
the shortest road was by the Hocking Valley Railroad
directly through Toledo. Another route by way of Sandusky
existed; and even a third through Sandusky, thence over to
Springfield, and in by the side door, so to speak, to Columbus.
This last routing was due to the fact that the Big Four road
from Sandusky diagonally across to Springfield had no access
to Columbus except through a branch line from Springfield.
This last-named zigzag route was 295 miles in length as against
190 miles by the direct line through Toledo. To Springfield,
on the other hand, no direct route from Hillsdale existed; but
freight might move either <i>via</i> Sandusky by the Big Four road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>or through Sandusky and around by way of Columbus. The
shortest of any of these lines to Springfield, however, was
twenty-nine miles longer than the shortest line to Columbus.
This established Columbus, therefore, as normally the nearer
point. Complaint arose from the fact that ice carried over
the zigzag route to Columbus actually passed through Springfield
and forty-five miles beyond to reach its destination.
For such shipments over the Big Four road, Springfield instead
of Columbus was the nearer point. But, contrariwise,
for ice coming to Springfield through Columbus, the latter in
turn became the intermediate point.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The specific complaint
was that the rate by all routes to Springfield was one dollar
per ton, while to Columbus it was only eighty cents. Originally,
the rate was higher ($1.25 per ton), but was the same to
both points. Is this a case of local discrimination or not?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/illus240.jpg" width="592" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>The Big Four road operating through Springfield answered
that it was not responsible for the eighty cent rate to Columbus;
that this was made by the direct line; and that it obviously
must meet this rate or withdraw from the ice business. It
alleged, moreover, that the rate of one dollar was reasonable
in itself as compared with other rates in the same territory,
and was in fact substantially less than it formerly was; nor
would its withdrawal from Columbus ice business evidently
be of any advantage whatever to Springfield, but would indeed
deprive it of some small contribution to joint expenses of operation
on all its tonnage. No evidence being offered that Springfield
was positively injured by this adjustment, the Commission
properly dismissed the complaint.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of this class of cases, as has been
said, is that the intermediate point preferring the complaint
is always on a roundabout route.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> St. Cloud, Minnesota, and
Wichita, Kansas, whose contentions are described hereafter in
detail, were thus situated. The so-called "rare and peculiar"
case of Youngstown, Ohio, cited in the original Louisville and
Nashville decision of 1889, was in no sense different. It was a
case of pure competition of routes.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Traffic to New York was
starting its journey from Pittsburg, over the rails of the same
company, in exactly opposite directions. Some of it went east
by the direct line; while other freight first moved due west,
thence north, by way of Youngstown, Ohio, until it reached
the main line at Erie, which took it on to New York. This
traffic, therefore, described three sides of a rectangle in reaching
its destination, traversing a route 172 miles longer than by the
direct line. The issue was raised by a demand for as low a
rate to New York from Youngstown as Pittsburg enjoyed, on
the ground that it was nearer New York by this indirect line;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>Pittsburg traffic, in other words, passing through it <i>en route</i>
to the seaboard. The reply, of course, was that, although
nearer by an indirect road, it was more distant by the natural
and shortest route, and consequently should pay more for the
service. What the roundabout line was really demanding
was permission to compete at Pittsburg for New York business,
without being compelled to reduce its local rates from intermediate
points like Youngstown. In other words, the long
line was demanding exemption from the long and short haul
clause, while the direct short line conformed to it. Without
such exemption it could not continue to reach out for Pittsburg
business, as the loss incident to reduction of its local rates
would outweigh the profit in the competitive tonnage.</p>

<p>One side of the Savannah Freight Bureau Fertilizer case<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>&mdash;namely,
the complaints of local stations on a roundabout road&mdash;brings
it within our first category. The roundabout line
from Charleston to Valdosta, shown upon the map at p. <a href="#Page_648">648</a>,
was 413 miles long as against a direct route of only 273 miles.
Kathleen, Georgia, is only 288 miles out from Charleston on
this indirect line,&mdash;approximately the same distance as Valdosta,
which thus corresponds to Y in the oyster case. Yet
Kathleen paid a rate of $3.32 per ton on fertilizer from Charleston
as against $2.48 charged to Valdosta, 125 miles beyond.
But this excess distance is by an indirect route. Most of the
notable English cases concerning local discrimination appear
to be of the same stamp.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The complaints of a number of
smaller places in the St. Paul-Milwaukee territory, like Cannon
Falls, Lacrosse, and Northfield some years ago, reduce in part
to the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Whether the Troy, Alabama, and Wichita,
Kansas, cases belong here or in the next group is indeterminate,
owing to the difficulty of comparing conditions of carriage by
rail and by water, respectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the set of circumstances shown in diagram
B (page <a href="#Page_219">219</a>, <i>supra</i>) is of quite a different sort. The
justification for the local discrimination is much less clear.
Here, as before, the distant point Y enjoys a lower rate than X
because of the presence of competition; but it is important
to inquire both as to the nature and the amount of it. In the
first case, competitive traffic from Y was <i>extra</i> rather than
normal in character, so far as the line serving X was concerned.
It was relatively small in amount. Whatever surplus revenue
resulted from it aided the local tariffs, including those at X,
in supporting the burden of fixed expenses. This burden they
were bound to bear entirely in the absence of competitive business
picked up at Y. The distant point Y of course had no
complaint in any event, and the chances are that X was benefited,
as we have seen. But in the second case the great bulk
of the traffic from Y belongs naturally to the direct line through
X. It constitutes the mainstay of its business. The direct
line, unlike the roundabout one, cannot withdraw from the
field when rates become unremunerative. It is in this business
passing directly through X to stay. Nine-tenths of the Y
traffic, perhaps, moves through X in this latter case; in the
former one, one-tenth would perhaps measure the proportion
of the indirect line. Under this assumption, it is obvious that
the question of the level of rates at Y, as determined by the
presence of competition, assumes a ninefold greater importance
in the eyes of X, so far as the effect upon local rates in supporting
the fixed and joint expenses of the road is concerned. In
any event, even the line operating under a disability supposedly
earns some small net return on competitive traffic, else it would
withdraw from the field. This it is in fact free to do at any
time; and, however small the net return, it is at least all gain.
On the other hand, when the net return on a large volume of
its natural business becomes unduly small, the financial stability
of the direct line is put in jeopardy. The danger of local
rates (as at X) being actually enhanced or at least prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
from reduction, because of an unduly low level of competitive
rates at more distant points, is thus much greater when X is a
way station on a direct line than when, as in our first instance,
it is an intermediate point on a roundabout route. For this
reason the direct line through X is at the outset put to a justification
of its local tariffs, as to whether they are inherently
reasonable or not; first, by comparison with the general level
throughout the surrounding territory; and, secondly, as
yielding a return on the capital actually invested. This seems
to have been the line of reasoning which the Interstate Commerce
Commission adopted in the recent important Spokane,
Washington, cases.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The low through rates to the Pacific
coast were established as reasonable by the competition of sea
routes round the Horn, and especially by the newly-opened
Tehuantepec Railroad. The only ground for finding there
was discrimination against Spokane was an inherent unreasonableness
in its rate. This was, in fact, the outcome; the
decision being rendered notable, further, by reason of the
prominence given to the valuation of the railroads' property
as a basis of judgment.</p>

<p>The first important point to be established, then, in this
second variety of the oyster case was as to the relative distribution
of traffic from the more distant competitive point by
the several lines open to it. The next concerned the absolute
reasonableness of the rate at the intermediate point. In the
third place, we must inquire whether the rate at the more
distant point may not be unreasonably low. This was a contingency
not possible, as we have just seen, in the Spokane
case. But others may be different in this regard. One is thus
forced to consider the effect of the presence of roundabout competitive
lines upon the level of rates at the more distant point.
An indirect rival road may, as in the St. Cloud case, carry only
seventy-three carloads a day as compared with a daily movement
of one thousand cars by the direct lines. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
hand, as in the Savannah Freight Bureau case, Valdosta, Georgia,
may receive nine-tenths of its supply of fertilizer by indirect
roads. But in any event it is the potential, not the actual,
movement of tonnage, which may count in the long run. It is
indisputable that the short line between two points never pares
its rates down to an irreducible minimum except under compulsion.
The presence of a roundabout route affords just this
pressure to reduction. Even allowing that in the last analysis
the long line will strike bed-rock of no profit first, it is indisputable
that such lines frequently, instead of merely meeting
rates made for them by the direct routes, seek to divert business
by actually undercutting those rates. Having only a small
share of the tonnage, they take risks which would be fatal to
others. To transport at an absolute loss is of course no more
defensible than the argument of the merchant that the only
way to compensate for selling goods below cost was to enlarge
the volume of his business. But, of course, there is always
the chance that, by enlarging this volume sufficiently, operating
expenses may be so far cut down that a loss may be transformed
into a profit. The diversion of enough traffic from the direct
railroad line to accomplish this end would, of course, reduce
the volume of its traffic and thereby unduly burden it, to the
manifest injury of all local points like X.</p>

<p>Suggestive illustrations of lower rates at the more distant
point than are under the circumstances actually "compelled"
by competition of routes are to be had. In a recent case<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> the
rates on bananas from Charleston, South Carolina, to Danville
and Lynchburg, Virginia, respectively, were called in question.
The traffic moved through Danville on its way to Lynchburg,
sixty-six miles beyond, at a rate of forty-three cents to Danville
as compared with a rate of twenty cents to Lynchburg.
The reason for the low rate at Lynchburg was the presence of
a rival route,&mdash;bananas, coming in through Baltimore. But
the lowest rate "compelled" by this competition was in fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>thirteen cents higher than the Danville line charged at Lynchburg.
In other words, the long-distance rate was that much
lower than it need have been. This instance is analogous in
another way to our oyster case, inasmuch as the demand at
Danville being limited, one-half of the same carload paid the
Danville rate of forty-three cents, while the other half went on
at the lower rate of twenty cents enjoyed at the more distant
point. It is in this connection, of rates unduly low at so-called
competitive points, that the partial weakness in the railroad
arguments in many of the southern basing point cases appears.
Since the Supreme Court of the United States had held that
competition at the more distant point justified its lower rates,
the Interstate Commerce Commission was powerless to give
effect to whatever opinion it might entertain that at times it is
neither water nor commercial competition which actually brings
about the low rate at the basing point; but merely a consensus
of opinion among carriers that that place will respond quickly
enough to favors granted, to make it worth while to try the
experiment.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> This conviction is vastly strengthened, of course,
since entire monopoly among all the southern railroad lines has
become an established fact. It is an absurdity to speak longer
of any competition between rail carriers existing in a large
part of this territory.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Actual illustrations of this second variant of the oyster
case, free still from the complications of competition of markets,
are not common, but occasionally arise. Chattanooga, which
aspires to be the commercial and industrial centre of eastern
Tennessee, is about 150 miles southeast of Nashville, as shown
by the accompanying sketch map. Owing to the southwestern
trend of the Appalachian Mountain valleys, it is only
846 miles from New York by rail, almost as the crow flies; while
Nashville has access to the North principally through Ohio river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>gateways, over lines, at the best, 1,058 miles in length. By
these lines, therefore, the latter is 212 miles further from New
York than Chattanooga. But the two competitive places are
only 151 miles apart; whence it follows that the shortest possible
all-rail line from New York to Nashville, swings around to
the south by way of Chattanooga. The situation is complicated
by other combined rail and water routes from New York through
Norfolk, Savannah, and Charleston. But all these lines also
reach Nashville by coming up through Chattanooga. From
every point of view, therefore, Chattanooga, on the basis of
mileage, is the nearer point to New York&mdash;151 miles nearer by
the direct line, all rail; equally nearer by all combined rail and
water routes: and 212 miles nearer than is Nashville by the
roundabout all-rail lines through Louisville or Cincinnati. Its
location corresponds to X in our second variation of the oyster
case; namely, an intermediate point on the direct line to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
another more distant point Y, which latter enjoys the competition
of more roundabout routes.</p>

<p>The disability against Chattanooga, against which it protested,
was substantial.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Its first-class rate from New York
was $1.14 per hundred pounds, while Nashville paid only ninety-one
cents. On various commodities the Chattanooga rates
were from twenty-five to seventy-five per cent, above those to
Nashville. The effect of such differences upon jobbing business
at the places intermediate between Nashville and Chattanooga
is shown by the subjoined chart. The two upper sloping lines
represent the through rates from New York to each distributing
centre, plus the local rates out to way stations. Even at
Bolivar, the nearest place to Chattanooga, the Nashville combination
is slightly lower than that based upon Chattanooga.
This disability steadily increases as Nashville is approached,
rates from Chattanooga rising while those from Nashville fall,
until at Kimbro the jobber located at Chattanooga&mdash;the
nearer point to New York on the direct line&mdash;must lay down
his New York goods at a rate of sixty-three cents a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>pounds higher than his competitor in Nashville enjoys. This
adjustment is partly an historical product. Nashville, by the
old river routes from Pittsburg down the Ohio and up the
Cumberland, was formerly nearer the Eastern cities than Chattanooga.
Then, the trunk lines through Cincinnati with
heavy traffic and low rates shortened the distance; and, finally,
the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad, supplanting the river
routes, undertook to build up Nashville as against Cincinnati
and Louisville. Historically, on the other hand, Chattanooga
was long an unimportant point. It took, as it still does, the
same rate from the North as prevailed at some twenty-three
other southern cities from Atlanta to Memphis. Here is the
crux of the difficulty. The rates at Nashville must be assumed
as historically fixed. Whatever remedy may apply must come
from a reduction of the rates to Chattanooga, the nearer point.
This place has now become an important centre, the meeting
point of a number of rail and water lines. The long prevalent
grouping of all the southern cities with equal rates from the
North must be replaced by a system of differentials, if the
discrimination against Chattanooga is ever to be ameliorated.</p>

<p>By this time it will be observed that in the discussion of the
Chattanooga case we have drifted far beyond the mere competition
of rival routes. Commercial competition, which affords
the justification for grouping all these twenty-three important
southern cities together, is a topic to be treated elsewhere by
itself. The difficulty in many of these cases is to distinguish
between the really strongest line and the one which is merely
the shortest. Upon this point one's decision of the Chattanooga
case might actually depend. The Louisville &amp; Nashville
contends that Nashville even today is, from an operating
point of view, nearer New York than Chattanooga, although
the distance is 212 miles more. All the trunk lines compete
at Ohio river points, and bring them relatively much closer to
New York. The density of traffic on these lines is far heavier
than on the air line to Chattanooga.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>It happens that Chattanooga meets this allegation of greater
trunk line density and cheapness by proof of the still greater
economy of operation by the coastwise steamers to southern
ports, traffic coming thence north by rail through Chattanooga.
The appearance of water competition in any of these cases
always introduces an almost insuperable difficulty in the way of
comparison of long and short lines. Shipment by vessel differs
from rail carriage, primarily in the relatively high terminal costs,
the absence of all maintenance of way costs, and the low cost
of actual propulsion. With a cargo once securely stowed, the
distance traversed by a vessel is of relatively little importance,
much less so than in the case of carriage by rail. A powerful
factor in determining water rates, moreover, especially by sea,
is the absence of local traffic. Wharves and terminals being
expensive to build and maintain, and the method of loading in a
ship's hold not being conducive to ease in access or assortment,
vessels are confined largely to bulk traffic at a few important
points. The expenses of operation must be more uniformly
distributed over the cargo than in the case of a trainload. The
water line, therefore, is deprived of one advantage in cutting
rates. It cannot, so readily as a railroad, recoup itself for
losses on competitive business or at competitive points by falling
back upon its earnings from way stations.</p>

<p>From all these considerations it not infrequently comes
about that, unlike carriage by rail, the longest way round
may indeed be the shortest way home. This is clear in the
highly involved Wichita, Kansas, cases.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Wichita, a commercial
centre of southern Kansas, is 200 odd miles southwest
of Kansas City. Its all-rail rates from the East are higher
than to Kansas City. Yet by the water route from New
York to Galveston and thence up by rail, as compared with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>Kansas City, it is a nearer and intermediate point. The
Interstate Commerce Commission well expresses the difficulty:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is quite probable that the actual cost of transporting cotton
piece goods from New York to Wichita <i>via</i> Galveston does not exceed
that of carrying them from New York to Kansas City via the cheapest
route. The all-rail haul is to the latter point 1,300 miles and over.
The ocean and rail movement involves a rail carriage of from 1,100
to 1,300 miles, depending upon the route selected. If the goods move
through some Gulf port, there is a rail carriage of not less than 850
miles. If, therefore, the rate were to be measured by the expense of
the service, it is probable that Wichita would today enjoy as low a
rate as the Missouri river."</p></div>

<p>The Wichita complication, moreover, works both ways.
Wichita and Kansas City form two angles of a narrow triangle
with its apex at the Gulf ports; but the distance from Kansas
City is longer than from Wichita. Railroad competition
brought it about, however, that the rate on export grain from
Wichita <i>via</i> Kansas City to the Gulf came to equal the rate
from Kansas City to the Gulf <i>via</i> Wichita. But the former
was a much longer and more roundabout haul; and, moreover,
was less than the shorter haul rate from Wichita to the Gulf
direct. The analogy to the Hillsdale case, above-described,
will appear clearly on inspection of the map.</p>

<p>Summarizing the results so far reached, in all that concerns
the two sorts of cases considered in the preceding paragraphs,
our conclusion is that, when competition by rail at the distant
point is alone present, and when the nearer point is on a roundabout
route, a railway "is entitled to carry the traffic past X
to Y (Philadelphia) for considerably less than nothing"; but,
when the nearer point is on a direct line, the case is debatable.
Proof that normal competition compels the lower rate at the
remoter station must be uncommonly clear and conclusive.
In other words, the facts that the rate at Y is not unduly low
and also that the rate at X is not unreasonably high must
both be firmly established.</p>

<p>A distinct class of cases of local discrimination is suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
by the recent case of Montgomery, Ala., in the United States
Commerce Court.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> These like other cross line cases, akin to
that of Wichita, Kansas, above-mentioned, arise in connection
with practices as to the division of joint rates. They will be
discussed in connection with pro-rating in our second volume.</p>

<p>The question has forced itself forward constantly as to
whether the existence of the alleged discrimination in rates
is merely a matter of relativity in cost of operation or whether
it inflicts positive injury upon the nearer point. Would it
benefit the nearer point if the lower rate beyond were withdrawn?
It is here that the complexity of some of these cases
of local discrimination becomes apparent. To understand this
phase of the matter, the factor of commercial competition, as
distinct from mere rivalry of routes, must be introduced. Hadley's
analysis of the oyster case is quite inadequate on this
point. Rates in that instance were on commodities (oysters)
produced at practically uniform cost at both X and Y. They
were, moreover, rates <i>from</i> two places out to a common market.
Would it, however, make any difference if the controversy
concerned the rates in the opposite direction; or, in other
words, from a common centre of distribution out to two competing
consuming points? Would it make any difference
whether the goods were to be consumed at X and Y; or were
to be used as raw material in manufactures at those two points;
or were to be distributed throughout the countryside from
X and Y as jobbing centres? It is at once evident that these
issues are more complicated than in the first case. The two
points X and Y being commercial and industrial rivals, is it
not possible that the growth of one may take place at the
expense of the other? At any given time there is only a fixed
demand for the goods consumed, manufactured in or redistributed
from the two places. Trade won by one is quite lost
to the other. Of course, in a measure, this might also have
been true of the oyster production. But, inasmuch as in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
case the rate from Y was not affected by the entry of X, its
prosperity would not probably be disturbed. The Hillsdale ice
case, above described, is also one where the commodity (ice) is
of relative unimportance for Columbus and Springfield, respectively.
How would matters stand if the rates in question
were on lumber or coal for manufacturing purposes? The
difference, no doubt, is merely of degree and not of kind.
Magnitudes, however, must not deceive us. The rights of
Kathleen or Danville are just as sacred as those of Youngstown
and Pittsburg.</p>

<p>St. Cloud, Minnesota, is located upon a line of the Northern
Pacific Railroad, seventy-six miles northwest of St. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
It is a competitor not only with St. Paul, but with other local
centres in the vicinity, like Elk River, Princeton, and Anoka,
either for flour milling or for distributive jobbing business.
It is about the same distance as these other places from Duluth
or Superior; through which the entire district obtains its
supplies, such as coal from the East by lake boats; and by
way of which its flour must be shipped to the Eastern markets
and to Europe. And yet the rate on flour made at St. Cloud
to New York in 1899 was twenty-eight and a half cents per
hundredweight, as against a rate of twenty-one and a half cents
from St. Paul, this latter rate being enjoyed also by Milaca,
Princeton, Elk River, and Anoka. The rates on coal and
other supplies from the East were likewise proportionately
higher than to St. Paul and these neighboring towns. The
specific complaint in this case is of local discrimination. The
Northern Pacific Railroad operates the long line between St.
Paul and the head of Lake Superior by way of Brainerd. On
this business, passing through St. Cloud, it has to meet a rate
compelled at St. Paul by the competition of no less than three
direct lines to Duluth. It avers that this business, taken either
way for longer distances and at lower rates than are accorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>to St. Cloud, in no way affects the rates at that point; and
that whatever it can earn as a contribution to joint expenses
decreases the burden of these upon St. Cloud rates. This is
all entirely true from the transportation point of view; but,
viewed in a large way, the situation is altered. Wheat of local
production about St. Cloud is rendered of less value by practically
the excess of the St. Cloud rate per hundredweight over
the rate enjoyed from St. Paul. The Interstate Commerce
Commission found that this was equivalent to a difference of
fully $1 per acre in the value of wheat lands tributary to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Cloud. And on the other hand, of course, the cost of all its
supplies is enhanced above the level of rival manufacturing
centres. On soft coal this equalled no less than eighty-five
cents per ton. To this the Northern Pacific replied that the
discrimination against St. Cloud was not of its creation, but
had existed before its entry into any St. Paul business by
its indirect route. The Commission found, however, that
in fact the participation of this indirect line on St. Paul-Duluth
business did affect the short-line rate; and that its withdrawal
would at least tend to prevent any further reduction of the
St. Paul and related rates. If the withdrawal did not remove
the discrimination against St Cloud it would not at all events
aggravate it. The vital point, differentiating this case from
that of the Savannah Freight Bureau, previously stated, was
the actual damage to the intermediate point due to the existence
of commercial competition between it and the place more
distant.</p>

<p>An important feature in commercial competition is its
entire dissociation from all considerations of cost of service
by long or short routes. Neither strong nor weak lines make
the rate. The business is there. Market conditions are
fixed. The carriers are free to take traffic or leave it. Single-handed,
at least they cannot rule the price of transportation.
The price of sugar at Kansas City is made by competition of
Louisiana sugar coming from New Orleans, of beet sugar and
Hawaiian sugar from Colorado and San Francisco, and of the
world's sugar from New York. This is why Kansas City, in
the complaint stated in the opening paragraph, enjoys a lower
rate on sugar from San Francisco than the transcontinental
lines can accord to Denver. The only possible justification for
the apparent anomaly in lumber rates from Texas points, cited
in the same paragraph, is that, as the heart of the Middle West
is approached, lumber supplies from every point of the compass
converge upon common markets. As is so frequently averred
in such cases, no carrier makes the rate. The rate is made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
all of them by conditions beyond their control. The only
rates, therefore, which it is in their power to fix in some accordance
with average costs of operation, are the rates at local
stations. For these rates alone can they be brought to
book.</p>

<p>Just here another characteristic of commercial competition
as distinct from rivalry of routes is to be noted. Local
discrimination, wherever it is alleged to occur, frequently
assumes the form of complaint against rates to various places,
not on the same line but by different and often widely separated
lines. Complaints of this class might arise, for instance,
referring back to our diagrams of the oyster cases, between
X and Z. Philadelphia, we will assume, as before, to be the
common market. A multitude of different varieties of protest
are distinguishable. Point X equally distant from Philadelphia
with Z may pay a higher rate than Z. Or X may be less distant
than Z, and yet be called upon to pay the same rate. It may
even be less distant than Z and yet actually be charged a higher
rate than Z. But in all these instances the two points (X and
Z) are not on the same route, but on divergent routes. The
issue remains the same. The conditions imposed at the point
of convergence being fixed, each line must exercise its own
ingenuity in conforming thereto. Methods in each case must
differ, according to the length of line, the direction and composition
of the traffic, and other factors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three general schemes of rate-making are distinguishable
in American practice. The most satisfactory one is that
which obtains in trunk line territory, of zone tariffs with a
gradation in some degree corresponding to distance.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> At
the other extreme is the system of the flat or postage-stamp
rate, exemplified in the Missouri-Mississippi river territory,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
and in Pacific coast rates from all points east of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Intermediate between the two are the systems of basing lines
and basing points. The first of these, the basing line system,
prevails throughout the country west of the Missouri river.
The second, the basing point system, is found throughout the
southern states east of the Mississippi. In both the principle
is the same. The two differ only in detail. Through rates
are made to certain designated places; and from there on, a
local rate to all other places, large or small, is added. This
local charge rises, of course, with distance. Thus the first-class
rate to Denver, Colorado, is made up of a rate of eighty cents
from Chicago to the Missouri river, plus $1.25 for the balance
of the haul. From Chicago to a point in central Nebraska
the only difference would be a lower local. In southern
territory the rate to Troy, Alabama, equals the sum of the
through rate to the nearest basing point, Montgomery, and
of the local rate from there on to destination. The only
difference in detail between these two systems is that in the
western territory, all competing lines being parallel (until
the routes around by sea and back from the Pacific coast are
met), rates rise in all cases progressively with distance. The
complaint of local discrimination rests merely on the allegation
that the rate of progression with increasing distance is too rapid.
In the South, on the other hand, owing to the encircling seacoast
with deeply penetrating navigable rivers, the competing
routes from the East or North converge from different and even
from directly opposite directions. Hence it is impossible to
base rates upon extended boundary lines, like the Missouri
river. Rates must be based upon certain designated points.
This introduces a serious complication. Points, instead of
lines, being used for basing purposes, in the South, local rates
rise outward in every direction around each basing centre until
the sphere of the next basing point is met. And local rates to
points even back on the same line, through which the traffic
has already passed to reach the basing point, are thus of necessity
higher than rates to points beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/illus258.jpg" width="426" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The economic anomaly of rates actually falling progressively
as the length of the haul increases is graphically well
illustrated in the accompanying diagram, based upon data in
the Georgia Railroad Commission cases.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The charges from
Cincinnati to local points on all lines converging upon Atlanta
equal the sum of the rates to Atlanta plus the local charges out.
This holds good even on the direct line from Cincinnati through
Chattanooga, as the diagram shows; yet of course it also follows
that rates must again decline as the next basing point is approached
in any direction; be it Montgomery to the west,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Macon to the south, or even Chattanooga to the north. The
only condition analogous to this in the Far West appears in
those places whose rates are made up by a combination of
the low water rates to the coast plus a local back eastward
into the mountains. The transition from this Pacific coast
combination to the system based upon the Missouri river
occurs at those places where the aggregate charges from either
direction become equal. Viewed as a large matter of principle
the whole western system is analogous to the southern system.
It is inevitable in both that intermediate points should in all
cases be assessed at a higher rate than those adopted as bases.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>The reason advanced in support of these basing point
or basing line systems is that they are an outgrowth of commercial
competition; in other words, that they are compelled
by conditions beyond the carriers' control. Sometimes it may
be the competition of widely encircling water routes&mdash;as from
New York around to Galveston and up to Kansas City in
the southwestern field, or to Mobile and up to Montgomery,
Alabama, in the southeastern states. But, in many other
cases, market competition from other centres of supply set the
limit to the rate at the basing point. Missouri river cities
enjoy a great advantage over all competitors, as meeting places
of the ways. Generally, the low rates to the base points have
been originally accorded in order to build up local distributive
or industrial centres in the face of competition from older
places. Nashville undoubtedly owes a large measure of its
present prominence to the fact that in the old days its principal
railroad gave a foothold and made a clientage for its merchants
as against older rivals in Cincinnati and Louisville. Nor can
it be said that this was an injury to that clientage, composed of
consumers all through the adjacent countryside. Rates for
these consumers were not put up, in order to build up Nash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ville.
On the contrary, Nashville was given perhaps inordinately
low rates, in order that the sum of these low rates and of
the local rates out to Four Corners should be at least as low as
those from Cincinnati and Louisville direct. This last argument
is the main economic defence of the southern basing
point system.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> It applies equally to the advocacy of a low
basing line at Missouri river cities for rate making to points
beyond.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The main difficulty with any system of basing points or
lines, which so flagrantly violates the distance principle, is
first of all to determine at what points to base; and thereafter
to accommodate the system to the normal growth and development
of the country. The system is inelastic. It tends
to break down of its own weight. It must enlarge, if at all,
by fits and starts, in each case with violent dislocation of trade.
A generation ago towns in Iowa complained that the Mississippi
river was a basing line. Then, when the Missouri river line
was substituted, an outcry rose from all the points in Nebraska.
The persistent complaint from Denver against its rate adjustment
as compared with Kansas City,&mdash;a competitive
distributing centre,&mdash;well exemplifies it. The Denver Chamber
of Commerce intervenes, and proposes that the basing line
be moved from the Missouri river out to Colorado common
points (like Denver). Indeed, in each case the argument in
favor of the change is identical. Each tier of complainants&mdash;thriving
cities which have recently come to more or less commercial
maturity&mdash;plead their inability to compete with the
centres adopted some years ago for basing purposes. Denver,
for example, wishes to sell goods throughout Utah. But its
total charges there on goods purchased in the East amount
to eighty cents from Chicago to the Missouri river, plus
$1.25 on to Denver, plus $1.64 on to destination,&mdash;a sum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>$3.69 per hundred pounds. The Kansas City dealer, on the
other hand, gets a low base rate of only eighty cents with a
single additional rate directly out to Utah of $2.05. In other
words, the latter can lay down his goods in Utah for $2.85 as
against $3.69 paid by the Denver competitor. The point to
be carried forward, however, is not so much the disparity
against Denver, as the fact that the moment Denver is promoted
to be a basing point it becomes defendant in a complaint of
precisely the same sort, brought by the places still further
west. This inelasticity of basing point schemes, together
with their inability to expand without abrupt dislocations of
trade, is apparent everywhere in the South. Just as Chattanooga
complains against Nashville, so the little intermediate
stations between Chattanooga and Atlanta, as our diagram on
page <a href="#Page_240">240</a> showed, become restive under rates of $1.27 as compared
with a rate twenty-one cents lower charged on to Atlanta.
The system of basing points or lines may be an inevitable
concomitant of industrial immaturity; but it is none the less
difficult to defend as a permanent system or as one inherently
just. And its final relegation to the scrap heap, in favor of a
system of rates graded more or less according to distance, is
ardently to be desired.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Does a constant rate applied over a long stretch on the
same line constitute local discrimination? May the nearer
points rightfully protest against the fact that equally low
rates are accorded to remoter points? This is the gist of the
controversy in the very suggestive Milk Rate cases in 1897.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Here the conflict of interest between producer and consumer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>is obvious. The city of New York naturally desires a wide
market from which to draw its supply. On the other hand,
the nearby producers wish to enjoy the advantages of nearness
to the market to the fullest degree. Study of the evolution of
rate sheets clearly shows how such grouping of charges over
long distances may be in the nature of a compromise to avoid
actual violation of the long and short haul principle. Oftentimes
places scattered along over a hundred miles of railroad
enjoy absolute equality of charges. Obviously, the ton-mile
rate steadily falls within such a group with progressive remoteness.
Yet it is an inevitable feature of tariff building.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> It is
the kernel of the admirable trunk line rate system. Such an
equalization of rates between points unequally distant from
a given centre, not infrequently arises in connection with
mere competition of transportation routes. Referring back
to the diagrams on page <a href="#Page_219">219</a>, it may happen that a complainant
at X, the nearer point, recognizing the inevitableness of a low
rate at Y, may succeed in securing an agreement that, while its
charges cannot be less than at Y, at least they shall not be more.
This was all that was asked in the "rare and peculiar" case of
Youngstown, Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> But it is apparent that such a solution
differs only in degree from those previously discussed. The
question of principle remains the same. The roundabout
route to New York up back by way of Youngstown could
continue to compete at Pittsburg for as low a rate as on direct
shipments, even if it observed the long and short haul principle
to which the Pennsylvania direct route was committed, only
by charging much lower rates per ton mile on Pittsburg traffic
through Youngstown than was levied on business there originating.
This raises precisely the same question of distribution
of joint expenses between local and competitive traffic, already
discussed. In certain contingencies under the second variety
of the oyster cases, such a solution might apply. Would
Chattanooga, for example, assuming it to belong in the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>class of oyster cases, be contented with an equality of through
rates with Nashville, leaving its local rates out to smaller towns
as they are?</p>

<p>The most extreme instance of uniform or postage-stamp
rates applied over long distances occurs in the transcontinental
tariffs from different points in the East. These differ
radically from the adjustment of rates between different points
on the Pacific slope, already described. At the far western
end the lowest rates are accorded to coast cities, because of
water competition by sea. Rates to interior points progressively
rise by the addition of locals inward toward the interior.
The rates thus compelled by water competition are accepted
by the all-rail lines. Thus the Pacific coast end is practically
built upon a basing line. It might be expected that in consequence
of water competition by sea a similar system would
prevail at the eastern end of the line; that rates to the Pacific
coast from interior cities would rise progressively according to
distance inland, until at all events the direct all-rail charge
became as low as by the combined rail-and-water rates. But
such is not the case, and for two reasons. The first is that in
the East interior cities are large and powerful factors in trade.
There were no such interior cities in the Far West, until Spokane
came into its own. These inland eastern cities, Pittsburg, for
example, demanded equality of opportunity with the seaboard
cities in Pacific coast trade. They succeeded in obtaining it by
a grant of as low rates as New York or Boston enjoyed. In
the second place, all the Pacific coast carriers enjoy monopoly
as far east as the Missouri river. But east of that line there
are many routes interested in middle western cities, but having
no interest in those in the East. They, too, have insisted upon
giving their clients in such places as St. Louis and Chicago as
low rates as Philadelphia or New York. Little by little the
equality of rates was extended until for many years the
blanket rate has covered the entire United States east of
the Mississippi river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Does not this constitute local discrimination against the
middle western cities? This was one of the main contentions
in the St. Louis Business Mens' League case. Being
one thousand miles nearer San Francisco, it demanded recognition
of that fact in its tariffs. The difficulty is accentuated
when both eastern and western point rates are considered
together. St. Louis enjoys no lower rate than New York,
although one thousand miles further east; and inland points
in the Rocky mountain area may be one thousand miles further
east than San Francisco and yet pay a higher rate. Thus it is
possible to lop off one thousand miles at each end of the line
without affording any recognition of it in the tariffs. The
situation is too involved to discuss in detail in this place; but
one finds it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the whole
system will demand revision before long. Geographical conditions
are immutable. Trade conditions are not. Perhaps
it was inevitable that the former should by force of circumstances
have been somewhat overlooked during a period of
rapid growth. But, as commercial affairs approach a condition
of stability and permanence, the matter will call for most
careful examination.</p>

<p>Constant rates applied over long distances on the same
line almost inevitably tend to pass over into a system of equality
of rates over <i>different lines</i>.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The necessity was evident enough
in the Milk Rate case. This phase of the matter may theoretically
best be discussed by reference to the following diagram.
Suppose A, B, C, and D to represent any four inland "common
points." It remains to show how it comes about that they all
finally enjoy equal rates to all four seaports, regardless of location.
Each appears to be naturally tributary to some one of
the seaports by a dominant or short-line route. In each in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>stance
this route properly rules the rate. Moreover, the four
seaports may be considered for traffic purposes as equally and
interchangeably distant from one another without regard to
location. This follows from the fact that, except in extreme
instances, rates by water do not vary according to distance,
so small is the cost of mere propulsion by comparison with
the terminal costs. In other words, the rate is the same from
Wilmington to Brunswick or Savannah as to its next neighbor
Charleston. From this it follows, further, that Wilmington,
Savannah, and Brunswick can all reach B&mdash;the point to which
Charleston is nearest&mdash;on even terms. They may each have
a direct line to B; but, as compared with a possible combined
low water rate to Charleston and a low direct rail rate inland
to B, the Charleston route may be at least able to hold its own.
All three outside competitors, then, are on even terms with one
another in respect of access to B. But how does Charleston
stand towards B as against the field? We have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
concluded that a roundabout route must be allowed to meet,
though not to undercut, the ruling rate. Such a roundabout
route from Wilmington on this diagram to its own natural
tributary A could be, and as a matter of fact is, made by passing
around by way of Charleston or any other seaport. Charleston
wishes to share in this trade at A, and may reach it by similar
tactics. It stands towards A precisely as Wilmington stands
towards B. They finally agree to enjoy both A and B on even
terms. But, as we have already seen, the admission of Wilmington
to B is equivalent to the admission of all the rest. Whence
it comes about that all four establish B as a "common point."
And of course the same procedure fixes all the others, A, C,
and D in the same way. In the Savannah Fertilizer case<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
it appeared that there were no fewer than 148 points in ten
states from Louisiana to Kentucky, to which rates on fertilizers
were absolutely the same from each of the four seaports. The
degree of local discrimination of course was negligible at the
remoter places; but it augmented in proportion as the immediate
neighborhood of each seaport was approached. The apparent
anomaly was greatest in a north and south direction along the
seacoast. Thus Dinsmore, Florida, was 275 miles from Charleston
and only 160 miles from Savannah, yet the rates from both
points were the same. The governing feature usually was the
entire equality of coastwise water rates, regardless of distance,
which in turn compelled the land lines to follow suit.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Freight Bureau case, otherwise known
as the Maximum Freight Rate case,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> affords the best example
of the difficulty in practice of adjusting rates over different
and widely separated lines on a distance basis, in order to
satisfy the demands of commercial competition. Atlanta,
Georgia, the key to the southern market, is 876 miles by rail
from New York, but only 475 miles from Cincinnati and 733
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>from Chicago. In other words, Cincinnati is fifty-four per
cent. as far from Atlanta as is New York; and even Chicago
is only eighty-four per cent. as remote. In general, this valuable
southern territory, on the basis of mere distance, is really
nearer to the leading middle western cities than to those on the
Atlantic seaboard. Yet this geographical situation is not
reflected in the railway tariffs. Rates from the West, especially
on manufactures, were much higher, always relatively and
often absolutely. Thus first-class goods in 1894 paid $1.47
per hundred from Chicago (733 miles), while from New York
(876 miles) the rate was only $1.14. At points like Chattanooga
the disparity was even greater. This city is only 595 miles
from Chicago as against 1,060 miles from Boston. Yet the
rates were actually lower ($1.14) from New England than from
Chicago ($1.16). The principal reason for this of course was
the cheap coastwise water competition by way of Charleston
and Savannah. The eastern all-rail routes could charge no
more than the combined rail-and-water lines. The difference
in relative cost of operation by water was recognized by means
of so-called "constructive mileage." From New York to
Savannah by sea is about 750 miles; yet the allowance to the
steamers was proportioned upon a distance of only 250 miles.
Water cost was thus fixed by comparison with rail cost in the
proportion of one to three. Yet, even with this allowance in
favor of eastern cities, New York remained more distant from
Atlanta than Cincinnati; the "rate-making" distance from the
former being 538 miles as against only 475 miles from Cincinnati.
The arbitrary reduction of the New York distance
left Chicago more remote (733 miles), but not in so great
degree as its tariffs implied. These tariffs were also peculiar
in another regard. The handicap against the western cities
was much higher in respect of manufactures and high-class
freight than upon foodstuffs and raw produce. This in turn
was clearly due to a long-established agreement between the
lines east and west of the Alleghanies, as to a division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
field. Originally each set of lines was harassed by roundabout
competition from the other. Western foodstuffs and raw
produce were reaching the South by way of the Atlantic seaboard;
and eastern manufactures from New York, for instance,
were rambling about over western lines in order to
reach places like Atlanta and Augusta, naturally served by
direct routes from the East. The agreement to divide the
field, dating from 1878, steadily became more irksome, however,
to the West, with the development of manufactures of its own.
The problems raised by this change are too large to be considered
here. The main question for the present inquiry is as to the
relative fairness of rates from two widely separated centres to a
common market, those rates not being proportioned to distance.
The final settlement of this knotty question is suggestive
of the extreme difficulty of attempting to apply mileage
or distance rates over different railroads too rigidly. The
complaint being as to relativity, there were only two possible
solutions.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> One was to increase the eastern rates, the other to
order a reduction of the charges from the West. The former
course was impossible, owing to the presence of water competition
by sea, not under control. The latter alternative was,
therefore, chosen by the Interstate Commerce Commission in
its decision in 1894. The rates from western cities were
always composed of two parts. The charge from the Ohio
south was kept distinct as a local rate. The other portion of the
rate applied from Chicago, for example, down to the Ohio
river. Of these two parts, the trunk line portion appeared
reasonable enough. It was the southern local, often one
hundred per cent. higher than the other, which seemed most
unreasonable; and which, according to all appearances, had
been used to bring about a closure of the market to western
manufactured goods. Consequently the Commission ordered a
reduction of the southern local rates, cutting them drastically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>but leaving the northern locals unchanged. This decision was
never carried into effect; as the Supreme Court of the United
States held the Commission to have no such rate-making
power. Nothing was done apparently to remedy the disparity
in charges against the West, although the railroads serving
that territory urgently pressed for action. Every time they
threatened a reduction of their western rates, the eastern line
came down in proportion. This left the relative rates as before,
although the general scale would be lower all round.</p>

<p>At last, in 1905, the eastern lines from Baltimore south
agreed to permit a reduction of five cents in the rates from
western cities by lines <i>north</i> of the Ohio river; but they
refused to accede to any change in the rates from the Ohio
south. This was the exact opposite of the Interstate Commerce
Commission's proposition, although both plans were
intended to compass the same object; namely, to place western
shippers more nearly on a parity with the East. The Commission,
in 1894, laid all reduction upon the southern portion
of the rate; the railroads, in 1905, placed it all upon the northern
part. This obviously afforded no relief to the original
complainant, Cincinnati. In fact, it actually operated to its
great disadvantage, inasmuch as it let its two powerful rivals,
Chicago and St. Louis, into the southern field on distinctly
more favorable terms. Such was the outcome as a result of
the friction of railroad competition. The reasonableness of
some reduction was clear. But to the layman, the fairness
of laying the reduction entirely upon the northern locals,
already relatively low, instead of upon the extremely high
southern part of the rate is not by any means so clear.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>One further detail of this adjustment of southern rates
raises a question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Rates between Richmond, Virginia, and Atlanta, Georgia, are
less than the rates between Richmond, Virginia, and Greenwood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>South Carolina (an intermediate point). This is due to indirect
competition between Richmond and Western jobbing points; and in
order to permit the jobber or manufacturer in Richmond to do business
as against his competitor in Cincinnati, it has been necessary to fix the
rates from Richmond to Atlanta with some reference to the rates from
Cincinnati to Atlanta. At Greenwood, South Carolina, we find that
the Cincinnati shipper pays a very much higher rate than to Atlanta,
and that the rates from Richmond are already sufficiently low to
enable the Richmond shipper to compete at Greenwood with the
Cincinnati shipper."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p></div>

<p>Is this not in a measure well described in the passage,
"unto him that hath shall be given; but from him that hath
not, shall be taken away even that which he hath"? This
railway argument contains dangerous possibilities. In effect,
upon the theory of charging what the traffic will bear, it means
that a railway (in this case the Seaboard Air Line) may increase
its own local rates, not in proportion to the length of its
own haul (from Richmond to Greenwood), but according to
the remoteness of that local point from another competing
market. The inevitable effect of the general adoption of such
a policy must be to erect arbitrary barriers to the free and
widespread movement of commerce. The great advantage
of the flat rate or of commodity rates is that, placing all competing
centres upon an absolute parity irrespective of distance,
they encourage the utmost freedom of trade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Certain general conclusions seem to be warranted by the
analysis of these cases of local discrimination. The first is
that they all show the extreme delicacy of commercial adjustment
and the existence of conditions well beyond the control
of the carriers, jointly or singly. Trade jealousies in particular&mdash;the
rivalry of producing and consuming centres&mdash;render
relativity of rates of paramount importance to shippers. This
class in the community is interested comparatively little in the
absolute level of rates, that being more directly the concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of the general consuming public. To the public, as represented
by State and Federal legislatures, it is difficult to make
these complicated matters of commercial competition clear.
The only basis of rate making that is easily understood is one
founded in general upon the distance principle, or, in other
words, correlated with considerations of cost of operation.
Any departure from this basis is apt to breed suspicion, and
at all events puts the carrier upon the defence. It is bad
policy, in their own interest, for railroads to permit a continuance
of such violations of the distance principle in their
general tariffs (commodity rates as a special resource to meet
the special needs of commercial competition may be set aside),
except in extreme cases. This was recognized by the trunk
lines when they almost unanimously acquiesced in the long
and short haul provisions of the Act of 1887. The people of
the United States have the same right that they had then, to
expect that at the earliest possible moment the wise provisions
of the trunk line rate adjustment shall be widely accepted in
the West and South. Whether those regions, and the railways
that reach them, have yet sufficiently developed to warrant
the change is a matter requiring careful consideration in
detail.</p>

<p>The necessity of some exercise of governmental control
over these carriers of the country, in order to mitigate, if
not to eliminate, local discrimination as far as possible, is
evident. Many of the instances previously cited have clearly
shown how impossible it often is for any railroad, single-handed,
to deal with an involved situation in a large way. Take the
Cincinnati Freight Bureau case, for instance. Conceding,
as many would, the claim of western cities to some readjustment
of tariffs in their favor, is it not an anomaly that the
lines south from Baltimore, several hundred miles away, should
finally dictate the means to be employed to remedy the situation
at Cincinnati and Chicago? Who else but the Federal
government could ever hope to disentangle the almost hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>less
snarl of competition involved in the controversy over
differentials to and from the Atlantic seaboard?<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> This controversy
is at bottom one of local discrimination. And yet
how is the Interstate Commerce Commission to aid in the
solution of these intricate problems under present conditions?
Its hands formerly doubly tied, are now in part freed by rehabilitation
of the long and short haul clause. But it cannot
yet deal with minimum rates, nor is it clear that it can prescribe
differential rates.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> True, the commission may, in some cases,
accomplish by indirection its purpose of establishing a proper
relativity between rates through the exercise of its newly
granted power to fix maximum rates. This, as we shall see,
was done in the recent Spokane and Denver decisions. Holding
that the charges at interior points were out of line with
through rates to the Pacific coast; and being unable to govern
the long-distance tariffs, it simply ordered a reduction of certain
rates at Spokane and Denver as inherently unreasonable.
This solution is not, however, always practicable. Not infrequently
the lower rate at the remoter point will drop as
soon as the intermediate rate is lowered. Thus the former
relativity of charges is re-established on a generally lower scale.
The complaint in the Eau Claire lumber case required the
exercise of such power over minimum rates, in order to remove
the disability against a particular centre. And then, finally,
it is indubitable that commercial competition as a "compelling"
factor has been somewhat over-emphasized by the
railroads. Too often conditions in part brought about by
themselves, or in which at least they have acquiesced, have
been set up as a defence for rates favoring certain points.
This is especially true of the southern basing point cases.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Whether any further grant of powers to the Interstate Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>merce
Commission by Congress is necessary at this time in
order to enable progress to be made in this connection, it is as
yet too soon to predict. The course of affairs for the next few
years will at all events bear attentive watching.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the case of competition between a direct and a longer,
more roundabout line, which one "controls" or fixes the rate?
It is an important matter, involving as it does the economic, if
not the legal, right of a carrier to participate in any given
traffic. Concerning this question the greatest diversity of
opinion prevails. On the one hand, both writers<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and practical
railway men<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> aver that the short line makes the rate, while
the long line merely meets the rate thus made. This is probably
the more prevalent opinion. Yet expert evidence of an opposite
sort is to be had for the seeking. The Interstate Commerce
Commission has repeatedly held that the short line is at the
mercy of the longer line under certain circumstances;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and
traffic managers not infrequently plead their inability to control
rate situations in the face of irrepressible, roundabout competition.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
There is evidently a confusion of thinking, or else a
loose use of terms where statements are so conflicting. As a
matter of voluntary agreement among roads, or of prescribed
rates under government regulation, the issue often assumes the
form of controversy as to whether a road operating under a
physical disability shall be permitted to participate in a given
business by a concession in rates or not. Thus in the notable
Milk Rate cases it was a question whether roads with heavy
grades should be allowed to make concessions in rates. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>issue really also underlies the question of enforcement of the
long and short haul clause. In the recent Spokane case the
Harriman lines to St. Paul asked that they, being long lines,
should not be compelled to reduce their rates to the figure
prescribed for the direct Hill roads.</p>

<p>It is clear in the first place that "short line" and "long line"
are merely used as convenient terms to designate differences
in the cost of operation. This was well put by James J. Hill
before the Elkins Committee of 1905.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We will say that the distance from Cincinnati to New York is
800 miles, and that they haul 800 tons behind one locomotive on one
per cent. ruling grades. Now somebody else builds a road with a
0.3 grade, and he can haul 2,000 tons&mdash;twice and a half the amount;
but that line is 200 miles longer. You can see readily that to move
a given number of tons the second road runs less than half the train
miles, so that the farthest way round is the nearest way home in that
case."</p></div>

<p>The problem should really be stated thus in terms of cost
not of distance. Suppose the roundabout line to be in part or
wholly by water, as in competition between the transcontinental
roads and the Isthmian or Cape Horn routes, or as between the
direct all-rail line from Boston to Nashville, Tenn., and the
steamer line from Boston to Savannah, and thence up to Nashville
by rail. In such cases the rail lines allow the water routes
a differential or constructive mileage in recognition of their
relatively cheaper per mile expenses of operation. The differential
may sometimes exist, where, judging by the bulk of traffic the
advantage, irrespective of the differential, lies with the line
giving the lower rate. In other words, as measured by volume
of business, the stronger line and not the weaker one enjoys the
benefit of the differential. This is the case in the coastwise
traffic between Atlantic and Gulf ports; where the bulk of the
tonnage goes by steamer and at lower rates than by all-rail
lines. The difficult point to settle in all such cases is whether
the allowance is made as a voluntary <i>concession</i> to the roundabout
line because it <i>costs</i> more to operate; or whether it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
toll or tribute, because, irrespective of the cost, the long line rate
is made on the basis of value of service. The problem, then,
resolves itself into this: how far in practice does cost of operation
really "control" the rate in cases of competition between
two lines differently circumstanced in this regard? If cost is of
fundamental importance, the "short line," using the term as
above said in a figurative sense, "controls" the rate. If cost
is an entirely secondary matter, rates being made in accordance
with considerations of value of service, the "long line"
holds the upper hand, and the short one is at its mercy.</p>

<p>It is important, moreover, in the comparison of costs of
operation, to keep in view the interrelation between fixed
charges and operating expenses. This point is often neglected.
Any well-considered outlay upon permanent improvements, of
course, increases fixed charges according to the extent of the
new capital investment; but at the same time it presumably
lessens the direct cost of operation. The interest upon funds
spent for heavier rails, reduction of grades, straightening of
curves, better terminals or heavier rolling stock, must be set
over against the direct economies resulting from heavier train
loads, lessened expenditure for wear and tear, for accidents
and claims or for wages. This relation between current expense
and capital cost was clearly emphasized in an arbitration
decision by the late S. R. Blanchard, already cited in
another connection. Two roads were in competition for business
at New Orleans. One had costly but convenient terminal
facilities. The other was so far from the heart of the city that
the drayage expenses were an important item. This second
railway began by offering free cartage to shippers in order to
even up with its more favored competitor; but this soon gave
way to the practice of private teaming by shippers with an
allowance on the freight bill for "drayage equalization." The
other road objected to this on the ground that it constituted a
virtual rebate; that in other words the weaker line was taking
business at an abnormally low rate. The arbitrator, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
upheld the practice, on the ground that the heavier operating
expense for cartage was merely an alternative for increased
interest charges, had the road elected to construct costly and
more convenient terminals. One road virtually paid money
for team hire, the other paid it in interest on bonds.</p>

<p>Analyzing the main question two propositions are certain.
Firstly, the long line can never charge <i>more</i> than the short
line; whence it follows that as the short line reduces its rate,
the long one must accept that rate as made; and, secondly,
the long line, costing more to operate, is, in the process of reduction
of rates, bound to be the first to strike the bed-rock
of cost incident to that particular service. To go below this
point of particular cost would obviously be indefensible from
every point of view. The general rule, then, is that "the short
line rules the rate." This is accepted widely in practice, as for
example throughout trunk line territory and between the so-called
Missouri-Mississippi river points, where the short line
from Hannibal to St. Joseph determines all rates by longer
routes.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> But the problem yet remains unsolved. The long
line may never be able to charge <i>more</i> than the short line&mdash;may
it, however, charge <i>less</i> under certain conditions? The
moment it is enabled to do so, the long line and not the short
line, for the moment, "controls the rate." If, now, we use the
technically proper terms, the question becomes this: Under
what circumstances is average cost of service in railway competition
set aside in favor of other considerations; or, otherwise
stated, when may a line, operated under a disability as to cost,
properly give a lower rate than its competitors notwithstanding?
Does disability justify a handicap or the reverse? This was
the form which the question assumed in the notable Milk Rate
case: as to whether the weaker lines in respect of distance or
grades should be allowed compensation therefor by permission
to charge higher rates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the common instances of rate control by a line
operating under a disability as to distance or normal cost is
the competition of a bankrupt with a solvent property. The
"roundabout" line, like the Erie or the old New York and
New England, having repudiated its fixed charges, undoubtedly
"makes" the rate which the other roads must meet or lose
the traffic. Usually they prefer to absorb or control it otherwise,
financially, thus substituting monopoly for a ruinous condition
of competition. Yet such instances resolve themselves,
evidently, into questions of relative cost of operation after all.
The bankrupt road holds the whip hand, because, having
repudiated its fixed charges, its average costs of operation are
correspondingly reduced. The validity of operating cost as a
basis of charges is surely not shaken by this exceptional case.</p>

<p>The relative proportions and the distribution of local and
through traffic upon two lines of differing length in competition
with one another are primary factors in determining
the ability of either one to "make the rate." This is, of course,
especially true under the operation of any long and short
haul law, under which any reduction of the competitive rates
would necessitate a lowering of the charges at intermediate
points. No road is going to sacrifice lucrative rates upon a
large volume of local traffic unless it can gain either a large
volume of business or a very long haul from a competitive
point. Many of the notorious rate disturbers in our industrial
history have been "short cut" roads&mdash;the shortest lines
between given important points, regardless of the nature of
the intervening territory&mdash;like the old New York and New
England, the Erie or the Canada Southern. Other roads, like
the Chicago Great Western or the Central Vermont, were
more roundabout, and yet enjoyed but little local business,
depending almost exclusively for their livelihood upon long
hauls between termini. On the Central Vermont at one time,
through business constituted seventy-nine per cent. of the
total; and only five per cent. was strictly local in origin. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
the other hand, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, in its original petition
for exemption from the long and short haul clause, stated
that eighty per cent. of its income was derived from local business.
This consideration, as applied to competition between
the two primary trunk lines, may not be without significance.
As compared with the Pennsylvania Railroad, rich in local
business, the New York Central, running along the narrow Mohawk
and Hudson valleys, has not inaptly been described as
operating "between good points, but not through a good country."
Under a strict enforcement of the long and short haul
clause, the dilemma on the former road would be more serious
than on the latter. To choose between its rich local
traffic in iron and steel or coal and the long haul business
from the West, would be a more difficult matter for the Pennsylvania,
than for the New York Central management to weigh
its through grain business against the local traffic from interior
New York points.</p>

<p>In one way the persistence of locally high rates in the South
and West, irrespective of the low charges at competitive points,
is defensible on the ground that local business is scanty.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The
roads cannot live upon it. Their mainstay is the long-distance
traffic from important points.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> On the other hand, where
there is no obligation to maintain a distance tariff, of course
the road with rich local business enjoys a great advantage in
making rates at competitive points. It can practically subsist
upon its revenue from its own particular constituency, meeting
all its fixed charges thereby; and can afford to cut rates on the
competitive tonnage down to the bone. Such a road, quite
irrespective of the length of its line, would obviously "control"
the rate at competitive points, as against any rival without such
a subsidiary and independent source of income.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>Volume of traffic is another fundamental element in the
determination of cost of operation. No matter how short the
line or how easy its curves and grades, unless it can handle
its tonnage in large bulk it will operate at a disadvantage.
Hence a most important factor to be reckoned with, in deciding
which of two competing lines is in a commanding position
as to rates, is the volume of traffic, both in gross and as susceptible
of concentration on either line. In the notable Chattanooga
case, for example, although the line from New York
to Nashville, passing around to the south by way of Chattanooga,
is 212 miles shorter than the lines <i>via</i> Cincinnati or
Louisville, the latter, by reason of the density of traffic in
trunk line territory, seem to stand at least on an even footing.
On the other hand, the enjoyment of the bulk of the tonnage
sometimes places its possessor at the mercy of a petty rival.
The Fall River water line to New York, carrying an overwhelming
preponderance of the business, obviously could not
afford to cut rates to prevent the Joy Line from stealing a
small portion of the traffic. The same principle holds good
in other lines of business. The Standard Oil Company can
better afford permanently to concede a small fraction of business
to a small independent dealer, so long as he knows his place
and refrains from ambition to enlarge, rather than to attempt
to drive him out entirely by cutting prices on a huge volume
of business. Occasionally independents are shrewd enough
to take advantage of this; and so to distribute their business
that they shall in no single place menace a powerful rival,
and yet comfortably subsist on the gleanings over a wide
area.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> In no single locality are they important enough to exterminate,
at the cost of cut rates applied to a large volume
of business; and yet in the aggregate they may make quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>a fair livelihood. The only difference between the status of
a railway and other lines of business in this regard is that
the railway may not be quite so free to deploy its forces. Its
territory and tonnage are more definitely circumscribed by
physical conditions of location.</p>

<p>A point to be noted in this same connection is the relative
stability of the traffic. Is it concentrated in a few hands or
does it arise from many scattered sources? In the former
case either road by making a bold stroke may so entirely capture
the business that, by reason of the enhanced volume,
a handicap in operation may be overcome. Thus, in the
notable instance of trunk line competition for the beef traffic
some twenty years ago, the Grand Trunk, although much
more roundabout, besides being handicapped in other ways,
by securing <i>all</i> the business, could afford to make rates impossible
under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Whether the business in question is natural or normal to
a road, or is an extra, diverted from other more direct lines,
is still another factor of importance affecting ability to compete
successfully for any given traffic. The best statement of
this is found in the argument of J. C. Stubbs before the Arbitration
Board on Canadian Pacific Differentials in 1898.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
"These are differentials in favor of weaker lines&mdash;lines which
upon the merits of their service cannot successfully compete
for the business, but claim a share of it as the reward of virtue,
the price of maintaining reasonable rates.... For example,
the Canadian Pacific road was not projected or built for the
purpose of developing, fostering, or sharing the carrying trade
between San Francisco and the eastern part of the United
States.... After they were built and the various connections
made, then, and not until then, it was seen that there was a
business opened. The route having been opened, the newer
and longer lines entered the field of competition against the
older, shorter, and more direct lines by cutting the latter's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>rates.... In a fight of this kind, paradoxical as it may seem,
the stronger line always got the worst of it.... The weaker
or longer line, not having any business at the outset, had nothing
to lose. Everything was gain to it, which appeared to
show an earning above the actual cost of handling the particular
lot of freight. Quite a distinction between that and the average
cost of handling all business. Such an unequal warfare
could not long continue, and the common result was that the
stronger line sought for terms, and ultimately bought the
weaker line off, ... this class of differentials is and always
has been obnoxious."</p>

<p>Our final conclusion must therefore be that the outcome in
cases of unequal competition in respect of cost of operation
can seldom be predicted with certainty. Everything depends
upon local circumstances and conditions. Sometimes the long
line and sometimes the short line will dominate. Careful
analysis of every feature of the business must be made before
positive affirmation is possible. This result is at all events
worth noting. A due appreciation of the complexity of the
business of rate making may safeguard us against the cocksure
statements of the novice, who has never closely examined
into the subject. President Taft has recently emphasized the
need of expert service in the field of customs and tariff legislation.
It is greatly to be hoped that a similar appreciation
of the care with which railway legislation should proceed may
prevail at Washington during the present session of Congress.</p>

<p>The general acceptance, both in practice and theory, of the
principle that distance is a relatively unimportant element in
rate making<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> is significant at this time, in connection with the
recent amendment of the Act to Regulate Commerce. It is
important also because of the marked tendency toward the
adoption by various state legislatures of the extreme opposite
principle of a rigid distance tariff. The old problem of effecting
a compromise between these two extreme theories by some
form of long and short haul clause&mdash;the original section 4 of
the act of 1887 having been emasculated by judicial interpretation&mdash;is
again brought to the front. For these reasons it
may be worth while to consider certain results which inevitably
follow the widespread acceptance of this principle of the blanket
rate. Its benefits are indeed certain; namely, an enlargement
of the field of competition, and an equalization of prices over
large areas, and that too at the level of the lowest or most
efficient production. But these advantages entail certain
consequences&mdash;of minor importance, perhaps, but none the
less deserving of notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The subordination of distance to other factors in rate
making is a logical derivation from the theory of joint cost.
This theory justifies the classification of freight, namely, a
wide range of rates nicely adjusted to what the traffic in each
particular commodity will bear, while always allowing each to
contribute something toward fixed and joint expenses. In the
same way it explains a close correlation of the distance charge
to what each commodity will bear. It assumes that any rate,
however low, which will yield a surplus over expenses directly
incidental to the increment of traffic and which thus contributes
something toward indivisible joint costs, serves not only
the carrier by increasing his gross revenue, but at the same time
lightens the burden of fixed expenses upon the balance of the
traffic. This principle of joint cost, so clearly set forth by Professor
Taussig,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> is fundamental and comprehensive. It pervades
every detail of rate making. But it rests upon two basic
assumptions which, while generally valid, are not universally
so. In the first place each increment of traffic must be new
business, not tonnage wrested from another carrier and offset
by a loss of other business to that competitor. And secondly,
each increment of traffic must be <i>economically suitable</i> to the
particular carriage in contemplation.</p>

<p>The first of these assumptions fails wherever two carriers
mutually invade each other's fields or traffic. Each is accepting
business at a virtual loss, all costs including fixed charges
on capital being taken into account, in order to secure the increment
of business. Each gain is offset by a corresponding
loss. It is the familiar case of the rate war. A less familiar
aspect of the matter is presented when traffic is disadvantageously
carried by two competing roads, each diverting business
from its natural course over the other's line. The sum total of
traffic is not increased. Each carries only as much as before
but transports its quota at an abnormal cost to itself. This
may, perhaps, swell gross revenues; but by no process of legerdemain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
can the two losses in operating cost produce a gain of
net revenue to both. And each increase of <i>unnatural</i> tonnage,
where offset by a loss of natural business, instead of serving
to lighten the fixed charges, becomes a dead weight upon all
the remaining traffic. The commonest exemplification of this
is found in the circuitous transportation of goods, instances of
which will be given later.</p>

<p>The second case in which the principle of joint cost fails to
justify charges fixed according to what the traffic will bear may
arise in the invasion of two remote markets by one another;
or, as it might be more aptly phrased, in the overlapping of two
distant markets. A railroad is simultaneously transporting
goods of like quality in opposite directions. Chicago is selling
standard hardware in New York, while New York is doing the
same thing in Chicago. Prices are the same in both markets.
Of course if the two grades of hardware are of unequal quality,
or if they are like goods produced at different cost, an entirely
distinct phase of territorial competition is created. But we are
assuming that these are standard goods and that there are no
such differences either in quality or efficiency of production.
What is the result? Is each increment of business to the railroad
a gain to it and to the community? The goods being
produced at equal cost in both places, the transportation charge
must be deducted from profits. For it is obvious that the selling
price cannot be much enhanced. The level of what the
traffic will bear is determined not, as usual, by the value of the
goods but by other considerations. The traffic will bear relatively
little, no matter how high its grade. The result is that
the carrier, in order to secure the tonnage, must accept it at a
very low rate, despite the length of the haul.</p>

<p>This is the familiar case of the special or commodity rate
granted to build up business in a distant market. Special rates
confessedly form three-fourths of the tonnage of American railways,
as has already been said. The assumption is usually
made that such traffic is a gain to the railways, justified on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
principle of joint cost as already explained. But does it really
hold good in our hypothetical case? There is a gain of traffic
in both directions, to be sure. But must it not be accepted at
so low a rate that it falls perilously near the actual operating
cost? It is possible that even here it may add something to the
carriers' revenue, and thereby lighten the joint costs in other
directions. But how about the community and the shipping
producers? Are any more goods sold? Perhaps the widened
market may stimulate competition, unless that is already keen
enough among local producers in each district by itself. The
net result would seem to be merely that the railroads' gain is
the shippers' loss. There is no addition to, but merely an
exchange of, place values. Both producers are doing business
at an abnormal distance under mutually disadvantageous
circumstances. It may be said, perhaps, that the situation
will soon correct itself. If the freight rates reduce profits, each
group of producers will tend to draw back from the distant
field. This undoubtedly happens in many cases. But the
influence of the railway is antagonistic to such withdrawal.
It is the railway's business to widen, not to restrict, the area
of markets. "The more they scatter the better it is for the
railroads." "Keep everyone in business everywhere." And
if necessary to give a fillip to languishing competition, do so
by a concession in rates. Is there not danger that with a host
of eager freight solicitors in the field, and equally ambitious
traffic managers in command, a good thing may be overdone,
to the disadvantage of the railway, the shippers and the consuming
public?</p>

<p>An objection to this chain of reasoning arises at this point.
Why need the public or other shippers be concerned about the
railways' policy in this regard? Is not each railway the best
judge for itself of the profitableness of long-distance traffic?
Will it not roughly assign limits to its own activities in extending
business, refusing to make rates lower than the actual incidental
cost of operation? And are not all low long-distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
rates, in so far as they contribute something toward joint cost,
an aid to the short haul traffic? The answer will in a measure
depend upon our choice between two main lines of policy; the
one seeking to lower <i>average</i> rates, even at the expense of increasing
divergence between the intermediate and the long
distance points, the other policy seeking, <i>not so much lower
rates as less discriminatory rates</i> between near and distant
points. In the constant pressure for reduced rates in order to
widen markets it is not unnatural that the intermediate points,
less competitive probably, should be made to contribute an
undue share to the fixed sum of joint costs. The common
complaint today is not of high rates but of relative inequalities
as between places. It is a truism to assert that it matters less
to a shipping point what rate it pays than that its rate, however
high, should be the same for all competing places. This immediately
forces us to consider the consumer. What is the
effect upon the general level of prices of the American policy
of making an extended market the touchstone of success, irrespective
of the danger of wastes arising from overlapping markets?
That the result may be a general tax upon production
is a conclusion with which we shall have later to do. Such
a tax, if it exists, would go far to offset the profit which unduly
low freight rates in general have produced. In short, the
problem is to consider the possible net cost to the American
people of our highly involved and most efficient transportation
system. Our markets are so wide, and our distances so vast,
that the problem is a peculiarly American one.</p>

<p>Having stated the theory of these economic wastes, we may
now proceed to consider them as they arise in practice. Concrete
illustration of the effect of disregard of distance naturally
falls into two distinct groups. Of these the first concerns the
circuitous carriage of goods; the second, their transportation
for excessive distances. Both alike involve economic wastes,
in some degree perhaps inevitable, but none the less deserving
of evaluation. And both practices, even if defensible at times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
are exposed to constant danger of excess. It will be convenient
also to differentiate sharply the all-rail carriage from the
combined rail and water transportation. For as between railroads
and waterways, the difference in cost of service is so uncertain
and fluctuating that comparisons on the basis of mere
distance have little value.</p>

<p>Recent instances of wasteful and circuitous all-rail transportation
are abundant. A few typical ones will suffice to show
how common the evil is. President Ramsay of the Wabash
has testified as to the roundabout competition with the Pennsylvania
Railroad between Philadelphia and Pittsburg by which
sometimes as much as fifty-seven per cent. of traffic between
those two points may be diverted from the direct route. "They
haul freight 700 miles around sometimes to meet a point in
competition 200 miles away."<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Chicago and New Orleans
are 912 miles apart, and about equally distant&mdash;2,500 miles&mdash;from
San Francisco. The traffic manager of the Illinois Central
states that that company "engages in San Francisco business
directly <i>via</i> New Orleans from the Chicago territory, and there
is a large amount of that business, and we engage in it right
along."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Wool from Idaho and Wyoming may move west
800 miles, to San Francisco; and thence <i>via</i> New Orleans over
the Southern Pacific route to Boston.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> This case, therefore,
represents a superfluous lateral haul of nearly a thousand miles
between two points 2,500 miles apart. The Canadian Pacific
used to take business for San Francisco, all rail, from points as
far south as Tennessee and Arkansas, diverting it from the
direct way <i>via</i> Kansas City.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>Goods moving in the opposite direction from San Francisco
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>have been hauled to Omaha by way of Winnipeg, journeying
around three sides of a rectangle by so doing, in order to save
five or six cents per hundred pounds.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Between New York and
New Orleans nearly one hundred all-rail lines may compete for
business. The direct route being 1,340 miles, goods may be
carried 2,051 miles <i>via</i> Buffalo, New Haven (Indiana), St.
Louis and Texarkana.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> A generation ago conditions were even
worse, the various distances by competitive routes between
St. Louis and Atlanta ranging from 526 to 1,855 miles.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> New
York business for the West was often carried by boat to the
mouth of the Connecticut river, and thence by rail over the
Central Vermont to a connection with the Grand Trunk for
Chicago. To be moved at the outset due north 200 miles
from New York on a journey to a point&mdash;Montgomery,
Alabama&mdash;south of southwest seems wasteful; yet the New
York Central is in the field for that business.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The map herewith,
prepared in connection with the Alabama Midland case,
shows the number of lines participating in freight carriage
between New York and the little town of Troy, Alabama.
It is nearly as uneconomical as in the old days when freight
was carried from Cincinnati to Atlanta <i>via</i> the Chesapeake
and Ohio, thence down by rail to Augusta and back to destination.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
It was common for freight from Pittsburg to go by
boat down to Cincinnati, only to return by rail <i>via</i> Pittsburg
to New York at a lower rate than on a direct shipment.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Even
right in the heart of eastern trunk line territory, such things
occur in recent times. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton
prior to its consolidation with the Pere Marquette divided its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>eastbound tonnage from the rich territory about Cincinnati
among the trunk lines naturally tributary. But no sooner
was it consolidated with the Michigan road than its eastbound
freight was diverted to the north&mdash;first hauled to Toledo,
Detroit and even up to Port Huron, thence moving east and
around Lake Erie to Buffalo.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> In the Chicago field similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>practices occur. Formerly the Northwestern road was charged
with making shipments from Chicago to Sioux City via St.
Paul. This required a carriage of 670 miles between points
only 536 miles apart; and the complaint arose that the roundabout
rate was cheaper than the rate by the direct routes. I
am privately informed that the Wisconsin Central at present
makes rates between these same points in conjunction with
the Great Northern, the excess distance over the direct route
being 283 miles. Complaints before the Elkins Committee<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
are not widely different in character. Thus it appears that
traffic is hauled from Chicago to Des Moines by way of Fort
Dodge at lower rates than it is carried direct by the Rock Island
road, despite the fact that Fort Dodge is eighty miles north
and a little west of Des Moines. The Illinois Central, having
no line to Des Moines, pro-rates with the Minneapolis and St.
Louis, the two forming two sides of a triangular haul. An
interesting suggestion of the volume of this indirect routing
is afforded by the statistics of merchandise shipped between
American points which passes through Canada in bond.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The
evidence of economic waste is conclusive.</p>

</div>

<p>A common form of wastefulness in transportation arises
when freight from a point intermediate between two termini is
hauled to either one by way of the other. Such cases are
scattered throughout our railroad history. One of the delegates
to the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1870, cites, as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>instance of local discrimination, the fact that lumber from
Chicago to Springfield, Illinois, could be shipped more cheaply
by way of St. Louis than by the direct route.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> And now a
generation later, it appears that grain from Cannon Falls,
forty-nine miles south of St. Paul on the direct line to Chicago,
destined for Louisville, Kentucky, can be hauled up to St. Paul
on local rates and thence on a through billing to destination,
back over the same rails, considerably cheaper than by sending
it as it should properly go.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The Hepburn Committee reveals
shipments from Rochester, New York, to St. Louis, Minneapolis
or California, all rail, on a combination of local rates to
New York and thence to destination.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Presumably the freight
was hauled three hundred miles due east and then retraced
the same distance; as New York freight for southern California
is today hauled to San Francisco by the Southern Pacific
and then perhaps three hundred miles back over the same
rails. Even if the rate must be based on a combination of low
through rates and higher local rates, it seems a waste of energy
to continue the five or six hundred miles extra haul. Yet the
practice is common in the entire western territory. From
New York to Salt Lake City by way of San Francisco is another
instance in point.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Of course a short haul to a terminal to
enable through trains to be made up presents an entirely
different problem of cost from the abnormal instances above
mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Carriage by water is so much cheaper and as compared with
land transportation is subject to such different rate-governing
principles, that it deserves separate consideration. Mere distance,
as has already been said, being really only one element
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>in the determination of cost, a circuitous water route may in
reality be more economical than direct carriage overland. Yet
beyond a certain point, regard being paid to the relative cost
per mile of the two modes of transport, water-borne traffic may
entail economic wastes not incomparable to those arising in
land transportation. In international trade, entirely confined
to vessel carriage, a few examples will suffice for illustration.
Machinery for a stamp mill, it was found, could be shipped from
Chicago to San Francisco by way of Shanghai, China, for
fifteen cents per hundredweight less than by way of the economically
proper route. Were the goods ever really sent by so
indirect a route?<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It would appear so when wheat may
profitably be carried from San Francisco to Watertown, Massachusetts,
after having been taken to Liverpool, stored there,
reshipped to Boston, thereafter, even paying the charges of a
local haul of nearly ten miles;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> or when shipments from Liverpool
to New York may be made <i>via</i> Montreal to Chicago, and
thence back to destination.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> I am credibly informed that
shipments of the American Tobacco Company from Louisville,
Kentucky, to Japan used commonly to go <i>via</i> Boston. Denver
testimony is to the effect that machinery, made in Colorado,
shipped to Sydney, Australia, can be transported <i>via</i> Chicago
for one-half the rate for the direct shipment; and that on
similar goods even Kansas City could ship by the carload considerably
cheaper by the same roundabout route. Conversely
straw matting from Yokohama to Denver direct must pay
$2.87 per hundred pounds; while if shipped to the Missouri
river, five hundred miles east of Denver, and then back, the
rate is only $2.05.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>As a domestic problem, water carriage confined to our own
territory has greater significance in the present inquiry. Purely
coastwise traffic conditions are peculiar and in the United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>States, as a rule, concern either the South Atlantic seaports or
transcontinental business. As to the first-named class, the
volume and importance of the traffic is immense. Its character
may be indicated by a quotation from a railroad man.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now a great deal has been said, chiefly on the outside, about the
Canadian Pacific Railway seeking by its long, circuitous and broken
route to share in a tonnage as against more direct and shorter lines all
rail, and I propose to show to you gentlemen that not only have we a
precedent on which to claim differentials, many of them, and that we
also have numerous precedents to show that there are numerous broken,
circuitous water and rail lines operating all over the country that are
longer and more circuitous than ours, and still they do operate with
more or less success.... In saying this I do not wish to be understood
as criticising the right of any road to go anywhere, even with a
broken and circuitous line, to seek for business, so long as they are
satisfied that taking all the circumstances into account such business
will afford them some small measure of profit. * * *</p>

<p>"The distance by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Road, Boston to Newport
News, is 544 miles by water; Newport News to Chicago, 1071
miles, total 1615 miles from Boston to Chicago, against 1020 miles
by the shortest all-rail line from Boston, showing the line <i>via</i> Newport
News, 58 per cent. longer. The distance by the Chesapeake and Ohio
from New York to Newport News is 305 miles, to which add 1071
miles, Newport News to Chicago, total 1376 miles, against the shortest
all-rail line of 912 miles, 50.87 per cent. longer. Again the distance
between Boston and Duluth by all-rail is 1382 miles, against 2195
miles <i>via</i> Newport News and Chicago, 58.82 per cent. longer by the
broken route.</p>

<p>"The Southern Pacific Co., or System rather, in connection with
the Morgan line steamers, carries business, <i>via</i> New York, New Orleans
and Fort Worth, to Utah points at a differential rate. The distance
from New York to Denver <i>via</i> water to New Orleans thence rail to
Fort Worth is 3155 miles, against 1940 miles by the direct all-rail line,
showing it to be longer <i>via</i> New Orleans 62.61 per cent."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p></div>

<p>Allowing a constructive mileage of one-third for the last
named water haul,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> many of these even up fairly well with the
all-rail carriage; although a route from New York to Kansas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>City by way of Savannah, Georgia, would appear to be an extreme
case, owing to the relatively long haul by rail.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The
increasing importance of Galveston and the necessity of a back
haul to compensate for export business make it possible for
that city to engage in business between New York and Kansas
City, although the roundabout route is two and one-half times
as long as the direct one.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> As compared with these examples,
it is no wonder that the competition for New York-Nashville or
New England-Chattanooga business by way of Savannah,
Mobile, or Brunswick, Georgia, is so bitter. The roundabout
traffic thus reaches around by the southern ports and nearly
up again to the Ohio river.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The second great class of broken rail and water shipments
consists of transcontinental business. Goods from New York
to San Francisco commonly go by way of New Orleans or
Galveston,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> as well as by Canadian ports and routes.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In the
opposite direction, goods are carried about 1000 miles by water
to Seattle or Vancouver before commencing the journey east.
But more important, as illustrating this point, is the traffic from
the Central West which reaches the Pacific coast by way of
Atlantic seaports. As far west as the Missouri, the actual competition
of the trunk lines on California business has since 1894<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
brought about the condition of the "blanket" or "postage
stamp" rate. The same competitive conditions which open up
Denver or Kansas City to New York shippers by way of New
Orleans or Galveston, enable the Southern Pacific Railroad or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Cape Horn routes to solicit California shipments in western
territory to be hauled back to New York, and thence by water
all or part of the way to destination. How important this
potential competition is&mdash;that is to say, what proportion of
the traffic is interchanged by this route&mdash;cannot readily be
determined.</p>

<p>Transportation over undue distances&mdash;the carriage of
coals to Newcastle in exchange for cotton piece goods hauled
to Lancashire&mdash;as a product of keen commercial competition
may involve both a waste of energy and an enhancement of
prices in a manner seldom appreciated. The transportation of
goods great distances at low rates, while economically justifiable
in opening up new channels of business, becomes wasteful the
moment such carriage, instead of creating new business, merely
brings about an exchange between widely separated markets, or
an invasion of fields naturally tributary to other centres. The
wider the market, the greater is the chance of the most efficient
production at the lowest cost. The analogy at this point to
the problem of protective tariff legislation is obvious. For a
country to dispose of its surplus products abroad by cutting
prices may not involve economic loss; but for two countries
to be simultaneously engaged in "dumping" their products
into each other's markets is quite a different matter. In transportation
such cases arise whenever a community, producing
a surplus of a given commodity, supplies itself, nevertheless,
with that same commodity from a distant market. It may
not be a just grievance that Iowa, a great cattle raising state,
should be forced to procure her dressed meats in Chicago or
Omaha;<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> for in this case some degree of manufacture has
ensued in these highly specialized centres. But the practice
is less defensible where the identical product is redistributed
after long carriage to and from a distant point. Arkansas is a
great fruit raising region; yet so cheap is transportation that
dried fruits, perhaps of its own growing, are distributed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>wholesale grocers in Chicago throughout its territory. The
privilege of selling rice in the rice-growing states from Chicago
is, however, denied by the Southern Railway Association.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
An illuminating example of similar character occurs in the
Southern cotton manufacture, as described by a Chicago
jobber:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Right in North Carolina there is one mill shipping 60 carloads of
goods to Chicago in a season, and a great many of these same goods
are brought right back to this very section.... I might add that
when many of these heavy cotton goods made in this southeastern section
are shipped both to New York and Chicago and then sold and reshipped
South, they pay 15 cents to 20 cents per hundred less each way
to New York and back than <i>via</i> Chicago. This doubles up the handicap
against which Chicago is obliged to contend and renders the unfairness
still more burdensome."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p></div>

<p>The overweening desire of the large centres to enter every
market is well exemplified by recent testimony of the Chicago
jobbers.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A few years later, when the railroads established the relative rates of
freight between New York and Philadelphia and the Southeast, and St.
Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago and the Southeast, giving the former
the sales of merchandise and the latter the furnishing of food products,
the hardware consumed in this country was manufactured in England.
At that time we, in Chicago, felt that we were going beyond the confines
of our legitimate territory when we diffidently asked the merchants
in western Indiana to buy their goods in our market. Today,
a very considerable percentage of the hardware used in the United
States is manufactured in the Middle West, and we are profitably
selling general hardware through a corps of travelling salesmen in New
York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and special lines in New
England.</p>

<p>"What we claim is that we should not have our territory stopped
at the Ohio river by any act of yours. It is not stopped, gentlemen,
by any other river in America. It is not stopped by the greatest river,
the Mississippi. It is not stopped by the far greater river, the Missouri.
It is not stopped by the Arkansas; it is not stopped by the Rio Grande.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>It is not stopped even by the Columbia; and, even in the grocery business,
it is not stopped by the Hudson. There are Chicago houses that
are selling goods in New York city, groceries that they manufacture
themselves. Mr. Sprague's own house sells goods in New York city,
and Chicago is selling groceries in New England. As I say, even the
Hudson river doesn't stop them."</p></div>

<p>All this record implies progressiveness, energy, and ambition
on the part of both business men and traffic officers. Nothing
is more remarkable in American commerce than its freedom
from restraints. Elasticity and quick adaptation to the exigencies
of business are peculiarities of American railroad
operation. This is due to the progressiveness of our railway
managers in seeking constantly to develop new territory and
build up business. The strongest contrast between Europe
and the United States lies in this fact. European railroads
take business as they find it. Our railroads make it. Far
be it from me to minimize the service rendered in American
progress. And yet there are reasonable limits to all good things.
We ought to reckon the price which must be paid for this
freedom of trade.</p>

<p>One further aspect of economic waste may be mentioned,
especially as bearing upon Federal regulation so far as it
affects carload ratings and commercial rivalry between remote
middlemen in the large cities and provincial jobbing interests.
The actual cost of handling small shipments being about one-half
that of carriage by carloads, the cheapest way in which to
supply, let us say, the Pacific slope or Texas territory, is to
encourage the local jobber who ships by carload over the long
haul. For, obviously, distribution by less-than-carload lots
from New York, or even Chicago direct, direct to the cross-road
store, is bound to be a wasteful process by comparison.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
But in addition there are also, of course, the social factors to be
considered, which are of even greater weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>The causes of economic waste in transportation are various.
Not less than six may be distinguished. These are: (1) congestion
of the direct route; (2) rate cutting by the weak circuitous
line; (3) pro-rating practices in division of joint through
rates; (4) desire for back-loading of empty cars; (5) strategic
considerations concerning interchange of traffic with connections;
and (6) attempts to secure or hold shippers in contested
markets. These merit consideration separately in some
detail.</p>

<p>Congestion of traffic upon the direct line is a rare condition
in our American experience. Few of our railways are over-crowded
with business. Their equipment may be overtaxed,
but their rails are seldom worked to the utmost. Yet the
phenomenal development of trunk line business since 1897
sometimes makes delivery so slow and uncertain that shippers
prefer to patronize railways less advantageously located, even
at the same rates. The congestion on the main stem of the
Pennsylvania railway between Pittsburg and Philadelphia is
a case in point.</p>

<p>Special rates or rebates often divert traffic. The weak lines,
in that particular business, are persistently in the field and
can secure tonnage only by means of concessions from what
may be called the standard or normal rate. The differential
rate is an outgrowth of this condition. The present controversy
over the right of the initial line in transcontinental business to
route the freight at will involves such practices. The carriers
insist that they can stop the evil only by the exercise of choice
in their connections. An interesting recent example is found
in the Elkins Committee testimony. It appears that lumber
from points in Mississippi destined for Cleveland instead of
going by the proper Ohio river gateways was diverted to East
St. Louis. The operation was concealed by billing it to obscure
points,&mdash;Jewett, Ill., near East St. Louis, and Rochester,
Ohio,&mdash;and there issuing a new bill of lading to destination:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Dolliver.</span> And these people carry it up to this little
station near St. Louis and then transfer it to another station near
Cleveland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. Oh, no; to any point on the Central Traffic
Association territory. In other words, it may go to Cleveland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Dolliver.</span> Why do they bill it to Rochester?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. In order to get the benefit of keeping it in transit
fifteen days without any extra cost, first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Dolliver.</span> I do not see how that would affect the
question of billing it to Rochester.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. Because that enables the wholesaler to have
fifteen days extra time in which to sell the lumber.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>. Why haul it all around the country and then
reduce the rate on that long haul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. In order that roads that are not entitled naturally
to this traffic may by this process get the traffic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Dolliver.</span> What roads from Mississippi to East St.
Louis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. Any of the trunk lines&mdash;the Illinois Central,
the Louisville or the Southern Railway lines. The roads in Mississippi
south of the river are not parties to this arrangement, you understand.
In fact, as fast as they find it out they break it up, or try to. They do
not want their traffic diverted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Kean.</span> Does it not come down to this, that some road is
trying to cheat another on the use of its cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. Not only that, but it is trying to get traffic that
does not belong to it.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p></div>

<p>Wherever a large volume of traffic is moving by an unnatural
route, the first explanation which arises therefore is that rebates
or rate-cutting are taking place.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus300.jpg" width="700" height="585" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A third cause of diversion of traffic is akin to the second;
and concerns the practices in pro-rating. Much circuitous
transportation is due to the existence of independent transverse
lines of railway which may participate in the traffic only
on condition that it move by an indirect route. This situation
is best described by reference to the following diagram. Let
us suppose traffic to be moving by two routes passing through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>points B and C, and converging on A, which last-named point
might be Chicago, St. Louis, New York or any other railroad
centre. Cutting these two converging lines of railway, we will
suppose a tranverse line passing through B and C. Obviously
the proper function of this railway is as a feeder for the through
lines, each being entitled to traffic up to the half-way point, D.
But over and above serving as a mere branch, this road, desirous
of extending its business, has a powerful incentive to extend
operations. The longer the tranverse haul, the greater becomes
its pro-rating division of the through rate with the main
line. Traffic from C is of no profit to the tranverse road so
long as it is hauled directly to A. But if hauled from C to the
same destination by way of B, the profit may be enhanced in
two ways. In the first place the pro-rating distance is greater;
and secondly, such traffic from C not being <i>naturally</i> tributary
to the main line B A but merely a surplus freight to be added
to that already in hand, the main line A B is open to temptation
to shrink its usual proportion of the through rate in order to
secure the extra business. This same motive may on proper
solicitation induce the other main line C A to accept traffic
from B and its vicinity. The result is a greatly enhanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
profit to the cross line and circuitous carriage of the goods in
both directions around two sides of a triangle. Only recently
in a case in Texas the Interstate Commerce Commission found
that two roads thus converging on a common point were each
losing to the other traffic which rightfully was tributary to its
own line. In a recent case, ninety-nine per cent. of the business
from Chatham to New York was moving over a route 249 miles
long, when it might have gone directly only 144 miles, by pro-rating
with another road.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Our illustrative examples are not
fanciful in any degree.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>This roundabout carriage becomes of course increasingly
wasteful in proportion to the width of angle between the main
lines converging on the common point. And several cases indicate
that in extreme instances the two main lines may converge
on a common point from exactly opposite directions, while the
transverse or secondary road or series of roads forms a wide and
roundabout detour. The well known Pittsburg-Youngstown
case, cited in the original Louisville &amp; Nashville decision in
1887, serves as illustration. The Pennsylvania was competing
from Pittsburg directly eastbound to New York with certain
feeders of the New York Central lines which took out traffic
bound for the same destination but leaving Pittsburg westbound.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
Other instances of the same phenomenon occur at
Chattanooga, where freight for New York may leave either
northward or southward, at Kansas City and in fact at almost
any important inland centre.</p>

<p>Another extreme form may arise even in the competition
between two parallel trunk lines cut transversely by two independent
cross roads. One of these latter may induce traffic to
desert the direct route, to cut across to the other trunk line,
to move over that some distance and then to be hauled back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>again to a point on the first main line where it may find a "cut"
rate to destination. Grain sometimes used literally to meander
to the seaboard in the days of active competition between the
trunk lines. Wheat from Iowa and northern Illinois finally
reached Portland, Maine, by way of Cincinnati in this manner,
with a superfluous carriage of from 250 to 350 miles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Starting within 90 miles of Chicago, though billed due northeast to
Portland, wheat has travelled first 97 miles due southwest to avail of
the connection of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for Cincinnati, and
thence north to Detroit Junction, a total of 716 miles to reach the
latter point and save 5 cents in freight. The direct haul through
Chicago would have been 340 miles less, or a total of 376 miles only."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p></div>

<p>Another witness describes the route as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Property billed for Portland, Me., started 90 miles below Chicago,
although Chicago is on a direct line, and took a southeasterly course,
then to Springfield, from Springfield to Flora, then to Cincinnati,
and then over the Hamilton and Dayton system to Detroit, there to
take the Grand Trunk road to Portland. This was owing to the billing
system adhered to here with great tenacity. Property ran around
three sides of a square, and I lost money on some of that property.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p></div>

<p>This ruinous diversion of freight seems to have been dependent
upon the existence of active competition at Detroit and
ceased when the Grand Trunk came to an agreement with the
American lines. But there can be no doubt that wherever these
cross lines exist there is a strong tendency toward diversion.
In the recent hearings of the Senate Committee on Interstate
Commerce on railway rate regulation, a railroad witness again
describes the operation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vining</span>. Well, for instance, take the time when I was on the
Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad. Its connection at the south was
at Fort Wayne, with the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Road. We
took lumber out of Michigan and wanted to send it east. We had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>compete with lines that went by way of Detroit, that went perhaps
through Canada and that in some cases were shorter. Of course, if
we wanted to send lumber from Grand Rapids to New York we had to
make at least as low a rate as was made by other lines leading from
Grand Rapids to New York. That rate might be just the same from
Fort Wayne as from Grand Rapids, so that we could not get any more
than the low rate from Fort Wayne. We had to go in that case to
the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway and say: "Here are
so many carloads of lumber, or so much lumber, at Grand Rapids, a
part of which could be shipped to New York if we had through rates
that would enable us to move it. These other lines are carrying it for
25 cents a hundred pounds to New York. You join us in a through
rate of 25 cents and we can give you some of that business." ...
But if I were with a short line and wanted to negotiate with a long one,
I should try to put my case just as strongly as possible before the long
line. I should say to them: "We can not take 5 per cent. of a rate of
25 cents. It would not pay us. You know that; you can see that";
and they, as business men, would admit it. "Well," I would say,
"give us 5 cents a hundred pounds and we will bring the business to
you, and if you do not, we can not afford to do it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Cullom.</span> I think in some instances they have stated
before us that they gave 25 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Vining</span>. They might.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p></div>

<p>Whenever the cross road was financially embarrassed, the tendency
to diversion was increased. For then, of course, having
repudiated fixed charges, the cross line could accept almost any
rate as better than the loss of the traffic. And that this was in
the past almost a chronic condition in western trunk line territory
appears from the fact that eighteen out of the twenty-two
roads cutting the Illinois Central between Chicago and Cairo
have been in the hands of receivers since 1874.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>It not infrequently happens that the initial railroad may entirely
control a roundabout route, whereas shipments by the
most direct line necessitate a division of the joint rate with
other companies. In such a case the initial line will naturally
favor the indirect route, at the risk of economic loss to the
community and even to its own shippers. An interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>illustration is afforded by a complaint of wheat growers at Ritzville
in the state of Washington concerning rates to Portland,
Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> By direct line with low grades along the Columbia
river the distance was 311 miles. This was composed of several
independent but connecting links. The Northern Pacific
on the other hand had a line of its own, 480 miles long, which
moreover crossed two mountain ranges with heavy grades. It
based its charges upon the cost of service by this roundabout
and expensive line; and insisted upon its right to the traffic
despite the wishes of the shippers. The Commission upheld
the shippers' contention for the right to have their products
carried to market in the most efficient manner.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Another instance
on the Illinois Central is suggestive, concerning shipments
from Panola, Illinois, to Peoria, a distance of about forty
miles by the shortest line of connecting roads. Yet the Illinois
Central having a line of its own <i>via</i> Clinton and Lincoln transported
goods round three sides of a rectangle, a distance of 109
miles, presumably in order to avoid a pro-rating division of the
through rate.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Of course elements of operating cost enter
sometimes, as in the case of back-loading;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> but in the main,
the pro-rating consideration rules.</p>

<p>Rebates may or may not be given in connection with circuitous
routing. Sometimes the same result may be obtained when
one carrier merely shrinks its proportion of a joint through rate,
leaving the total charge to the shipper unaffected. Of course it
goes without saying that an implication of improper manipulation
of rates does not always follow the diversion of freight from
a direct line. The rate may be the same by several competitive
routes, shipments going as a reward for energy, persistency, or
personality of the agent. A recent case, concerning rates on
lumber from Sheridan, Indiana, to New York illustrates this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>point.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Sheridan is twenty-eight miles north of Indianapolis
on the Monon road. Quoting from the decision:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the division of joint through rates on percentages based on mileage,
the defendant line naturally prefers arrangements with connections
giving it the longest haul and largest percentages. Therefore, it carries
this freight at rates based on a carriage through Indianapolis by a
direct line eastward, while in fact it carries it in an opposite direction
north and west by a longer route, the reduced ton mileage being
accepted to secure the traffic."</p></div>

<p>The Iowa Central, cutting across the four main lines between
Chicago and Omaha, derives a large revenue from such diversion.
Coal from Peoria west, instead of moving by the
shortest line to Omaha, is hauled across the first three to a
connection with the devious Great Western line.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The motive
is obvious.</p>

<p>A fourth cause of diversion of traffic has to do rather with
the operating than the traffic department. An inequality of
tonnage in opposite directions may make it expedient to solicit
business for the sake of a back load. The Canadian Pacific
may engage in San Francisco-Omaha business by way of Winnipeg,
because of the scarcity of tonnage east bound. The
traffic to and from the southeastern states is quite uneven in
volume. The preponderance of bulky freight is north bound
to the New England centres of cotton and other manufacture;
while from the western cities, the greater volume of traffic
is south bound, consisting of agricultural staples and food
stuffs. To equalize this traffic it may often be desirable to
secure the most roundabout business. A disturbing element of
this sort in the southern field has always to be reckoned with.
A good illustration elsewhere occurs in the well known St.
Cloud case.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The Northern Pacific accepted tonnage for a most
circuitous haul to Duluth, but seems to have done so largely in
order to provide lading for a preponderance of "empties." In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>this case it did not lower the normal rate but accepted it for a
much longer haul.</p>

<p>Not unlike the preceding cause, also, is a fifth, the desire to
be in position to interchange traffic on terms of equality with
powerful connections. Mr. Bowes, traffic manager of the
Illinois Central, justifying the participation of this road in
Chicago-San Francisco business by way of New Orleans, well
stated it as follows:<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Of course the Southern Pacific Railroad, as you gentlemen know,
originate and control a very large traffic, which they can deliver at
various junctions; at New Orleans, where they have their long haul to
the Missouri river, and we naturally want some of that business, a
long haul traffic to New Orleans, and in giving it to them we place
them under obligations to reciprocate and give us some traffic. That
is one of the things that occurs to a railroad man as to increasing the
volume and value of his traffic for the benefit of his company."</p></div>

<p>A sixth and final reason for diversion of traffic from the
direct line may be partly sentimental, but none the less significant.
It concerns the question of competition at abnormal
distances. We may cite two railroad witnesses, who aptly
describe the situation. "We can haul traffic in competition,
and we frequently do, as I stated, at less than cost, or nearly so,
in order to hold the traffic and our patrons in certain territory&mdash;Kansas
City for instance&mdash;but we do not like to do it."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
Or again, "The Charleston freight is not legitimately ours....
We make on these through rates from Chicago to Charleston,
for instance, scarcely anything. But it is an outpost. We must
maintain that or have our territory further invaded."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> In
other words, the circuitous or over-long distance haul is a
natural though regrettable outcome of railroad competition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What are the effects of this American practice of unduly
disregarding distance as a factor in transportation? Not less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>than five deserve separate consideration in some detail. It
inordinately swells the volume of ton-mileage; it dilutes the
ton-mile revenue; it produces rigidity of industrial conditions;
it stimulates centralization both of population and of industry,
and it is a tax upon American production.</p>

<p>One cannot fail to be impressed with the phenomenal growth
of transportation in the United States, especially in recent
years. It appears as if its volume increased more nearly as
the square of population than in direct proportion to it.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
But do these figures represent all that they purport to show?
Every ton of freight which moves from Chicago to San Francisco
over a line one thousand miles too long adds 1000 ton
miles to swell a fictitious total. Every carload of cotton goods
hauled up to Chicago to be redistributed thence in the original
territory and every ton of groceries or agricultural machinery
exchanged between two regions with adequate facilities for production
of like standard goods contribute to the same end. How
large a proportion of this marvellous growth of ton mileage
these economic wastes contribute can never be determined
with certainty. That their aggregate is considerable cannot
be questioned.</p>

<p>These practices must considerably dilute the returns per
mile for service rendered by American carriers&mdash;in even greater
degree than they enhance the apparent volume of transportation.
Long-distance rates must always represent a low revenue
per ton mile, owing to the fixed maximum for all distances
determined by what the traffic will bear. Furniture made in
North Carolina for California consumption<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> cannot be sold
there in competition above a certain price. The greater the
distance into which the possible margin of profit is divided, the
less per mile must be the revenue left for the carrier. Yet this
is not all. Such would be true of simply over-long distance
carriage. But to this we must add the fact that some of this
long-haul tonnage reaches its remote destination over a round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>about
line, which increases the already over-long carriage by
from twenty-five to seventy-five per cent. It is apparent at
once that a still greater dilution of the average returns must
follow as a result. From 1873 down to 1900 the long and
almost uninterrupted decline of rates is an established fact.
Has the volume of this economic waste increased or diminished
in proportion to the total traffic throughout this period? If it
is relatively less today, at a time when ton mile rates are
actually rising, it would be of interest to know how far such
economies offset the real increases of rates which have been
made. Rates might conceivably rise a little, or at all events
remain constant, coincidently with a fall in ton mile revenue
produced through savings of this sort.</p>

<p>The third result of undue disregard of distance is a certain
inelasticity of industrial conditions. This may occur in either
of two ways. The rise of new industries may be hindered, or
a well-merited relative decline of old ones under a process of
natural selection may be postponed or averted. The first of
these is well set forth as follows:<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is always considered desirable to have a long haul, and the rates on
a long haul should be much less, in proportion to distance, than on a
short haul. This is a principle of rate-making which has grown up as
one of the factors in the evolution of the railroad business in this country,
and it has greatly stimulated the movement of freight for long distances,
has brought the great manufacturing centres in closer touch
with the consumer at a distance and the producer in closer touch with
centres of trade. It has been of undoubted benefit to both, though it
may oftentimes retard the growth of new industries by a system of
rates so preferential as to enable the manufacturer a long distance from
the field of production of raw material to ship the raw material to his
mills, manufacture it and return the manufactured goods cheaper
than the local manufacturer could afford to make it, and thus, while
building up the centres of manufacture, have retarded the growth of
manufacturing in the centres where the raw material is produced."</p></div>

<p>The other aspect of industrial rigidity is manifested through the
perpetuation of an industry in a district, regardless of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
physical disabilities under which it is conducted. Another
quotation describes it well.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Senator Carmack.</span> Is it the policy of the roads, wherever they
find an industry established, to keep it going by advantages in the
way of rates regardless of changes in economic conditions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tuttle</span>. I think in so far as it is possible for them to do so.
It has not been possible in all cases. We could not keep iron furnaces
running in New England; they are all gone.</p></div>

<p>One cannot for a moment doubt the advantages of such a
policy as a safeguard against violent dislocating shocks to
industry. It may render the transition to new and better conditions
more gradual and easier to bear. It has been of inestimable
value to New England, as exposed to the competition of
newer manufactures in the Central West. But on the other
hand, it is equally true that in the long run the whole country
will fare best when each industry is prosecuted in the most
favored location&mdash;all conditions of marketing as well as of
mere production being considered. If Pittsburg is the natural
centre for iron and steel production, it may not be an unmixed
advantage to the country at large, however great its value to
New England, to have the carriers perpetuate the barbed wire
manufacture at Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Each particular case would have
to be decided on its merits. My purpose at present is not to
pass judgment on any of them but merely to call attention
to the effect of such practices upon the process of industrial
selection.</p>

<p>In the fifth place, every waste in transportation service is in
the long run a tax upon the productivity of the country. More
men may be employed, more wages paid, more capital kept in
circulation; but it still remains true that the coal consumed,
the extra wages paid and the rolling stock used up in the carriage
of goods, either unduly far or by unreasonably roundabout
routes, constitute an economic loss to the community. In many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>cases, of course, it may be an inevitable offset for other advantages.
In the Savannah Freight Bureau case<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> (map, p. <a href="#Page_648">648</a>, <i>infra</i>)
Valdosta, Georgia, was 158 miles from Savannah, while it was
275 and 413 miles by the shortest and longest lines respectively
from Charleston. Valdosta's main resource for fertilizer
supplies, other things being equal, would naturally be Savannah,
the nearer city. Yet in the year in question it appeared that
nine-tenths of the supply was actually drawn from Charleston;
and much of it was hauled 413 instead of a possible 158 miles.
No wonder the complainants alleged "that somebody in the
end must pay for that species of foolishness." Whenever the
Colorado Fuel and Iron Company succeeds in selling goods of
no better grade or cheaper price in territory naturally tributary
to Pittsburg, a tax is laid upon the public to that degree.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> When
Chicago and New York jobbers each strive to invade the other's
field, the extra revenue to the carriers may be considerable;
but it is the people who ultimately pay the freight. The analogy
to the bargain counter is obvious. The public are buying something
not necessary for less than cost; while the carriers are
selling it for more than it is worth. Economies would redound
to the advantage of all parties concerned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What remedy is possible for these economic wastes? Both
the carriers and the public have an interest in their abatement.
The more efficient industrial combinations have taken the
matter in hand, either by strategic location of plants or, as in
the case of the United States Steel Corporation, by the utilization
of a Pittsburg base price scheme, with freight rates added.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
But probably the large proportion of tonnage is still shipped by
independent and competing producers. To this traffic the rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>ways
must apply their own remedies. Either one of two plans
might be of service. The right to make valid agreements for a
division either of traffic or territory, if conceded to the carriers
by law under proper governmental supervision, would be an
effective safeguard. This would mean the repeal of the present
prohibition of pooling. The amendment of the long and short
haul clause in 1910 (p. <a href="#Page_601">601</a> <i>infra</i>) seems likely to do much
toward accomplishing the same result.</p>

<p>Agreements between carriers previous to 1887 were often
employed to obviate unnecessary waste in transportation. The
division of territory between the eastern and western lines into
the southern states is a case in point. Thirty years ago competition
for trade throughout the South was very keen between
the great cities in the East and in the Middle West. Direct
lines to the northwest from Atlanta and Nashville opened up a
new avenue of communication with ambitious cities like Chicago,
St. Louis and Cincinnati. The state of Georgia constructed the
Western and Atlantic Railroad in 1851 for the express purpose
of developing this trade. As western manufactures developed,
a keen rivalry between the routes respectively east and west of
the Alleghany mountains into the South was engendered. A
profitable trade in food products by a natural, direct route from
the Ohio gateways was, however, jeopardized by ruinous rates
made by the warring trunk lines to the northern seaboard.
Corn, oats, wheat and pork came down the coast and into the
South through the back door, so to speak, by way of Savannah
and other seaports. On the other hand the eastern lines into
the South were injuriously affected by the retaliatory rates on
manufactured goods made by the western lines for shipments
from New York and New England. Freight from each direction
was being hauled round three sides of a rectangle. Finally
in 1878 a reasonable remedy was found in a division of the field
and an agreement to stop all absurdly circuitous long hauls into
one another's natural territory. A line was drawn through
the northern states from Buffalo to Pittsburg and Wheeling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
through the South from Chattanooga by Montgomery, Ala.,
to Pensacola. Eastern lines were to accept goods for shipment
only from their side of this line to points of destination in the
South also on the eastern side of the boundary. Western
competitors were to do the same. The result was the recognition
of natural rights of each to its territory. This agreement
has now formed the basis of railway tariffs into the southern
states for almost a generation. Similar agreements, on a less
extensive scale, are commonly used to great advantage. Thus
in the "common point" territory formerly tributary to Wilmington,
Savannah and Charleston, the first named city insisted
upon its right to an equal rate with the other two, no
matter how great the disparity of distance. The Southern
Railway and Steamship Association arbitrated the matter,
fixing a line beyond which Wilmington was to be excluded.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Obviously such agreements have no force in law at the present
time. The only way to give effect to them is for connecting
carriers to refuse to make a joint through rate. This effectually
bars the traffic. Moreover entire unanimity of action is essential.
Every road must be a party to the compact. Otherwise
the traffic will reach its destination by shrunken rates and a
more circuitous carriage even than before.</p>

<p>One cannot fail to be impressed in Austria and Germany
with the economic advantages of an entirely unified system of
operation. No devious routing is permitted. Certain lines are
designated for the heavy through traffic, and concentration on
them is effected to the exclusion of all others. Between Berlin
and Bremen, for example, practically all through traffic is routed
by three direct lines. No roundabout circuits occur because of
the complete absence of railway competition. No independent
lines have to be placated. The sole problem is to cause the
tonnage to be most directly and economically transported. And
this end is constantly considered in all pooling or through-traffic
arrangements with the railway systems independently operated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>The Prussian pooling agreements with the Bavarian railways
are typical. Each party to the contract originally bound
itself not to route freight over any line exceeding the shortest
direct one in distance by more than twenty per cent. Compare
this with some of our American examples of surplus haulage of
fifty or sixty per cent! And within the last year, the renewal
of these interstate governmental railway pools in Germany has
provided for a reduction of excessive haulage to ten per cent.
The problem of economical operation in Austria-Hungary with
its mixed governmental and private railways is more difficult.
But no arrangements are permitted which result in such wastes
as we have instanced under circumstances of unlimited competition
in the United States.</p>

<p>A more consistent enforcement of the long and short haul
principle might provide a remedy almost as effective as pooling.
The Alabama Midland decision nullified a salutary provision
of the law of 1887 by holding that railway competition at
the more distant point might create such dissimilarity of circumstances
as to justify a higher rate to intermediate stations.
Turn to our diagram on page <a href="#Page_282">282</a> and observe the effect.
Traffic around two sides of a triangle from A to C by way of
B is carried at a rate equal to the charge for the direct haul
from A to C; or it may be even at a lower differential rate.
Complaint arises from the intermediate points y and x of relatively
unreasonable charges. The roundabout route replies
with the usual argument about a small contribution toward
fixed charges from the long haul tonnage, which lessens the
burden upon the intermediate rate. This is cogent enough up
to a certain point. It might justify a lower rate to D, on the
natural division of line territory. It might be defensible on
principle to accord D a lower rate than x or possibly even than
y. To deny the validity of lower rates to z or C would however
at once follow from the same premises.</p>

<p>Under the new long and short haul clause, what may be done
by the Interstate Commerce Commission? This body roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
determining the location of D, a natural division point, would
then refuse to permit A B, B C to charge less to either z or C
than to any intermediate point, x, B or y. Coincidently it
would bar the other road A C, C B from any lower through
rate to points beyond D, such as x, B or y than to any intermediate
station. Two courses would be open to the roads.
They must either mutually withdraw from all business beyond
D or reduce their rates to all intermediate points correspondingly.
In a sparsely settled region with little local business,
they might conceivably choose the latter expedient. But in
the vast majority of cases the roads would prefer to withdraw
from the unreasonably distant fields.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Simultaneously taken
by each line, such action would put an end to the economic
waste. At the same time it would terminate one of the most
persistent causes of rebates and personal favoritism. To be
sure it would generally operate in favor of the strong, direct
lines as against the weak and roundabout ones. Great benefit
would accrue to the Pennsylvania, the Illinois Central or the
Union Pacific railroads. The activities of the parasitic roads
and the scope of parasitic operations by the substantial roads
would inevitably be curtailed. Much justice would be done and
much local irritation and popular discontent would be allayed.</p>

<p>Imagine the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, a Chicago mail-order
catalogue and a United States protective tariff law blended in a
single volume, and you have a freight classification as it exists
in the United States at the present time! A few selections
from the first and last items of such a document are reproduced
on the preceding pages. They give some idea of the amazing
scope of trade. Such a classification is, first of all, a list of
every possible commodity which may move by rail, from
Academy or Artist's Board and Accoutrements to Xylophones
and Zylonite. In this list one finds Algarovilla, Bagasse,
"Pie Crust, Prepared"; Artificial Hams, Cattle Tails and
Wombat Skins; Wings, Crutches, Cradles, Baby Jumpers and
all; together with Shoo Flies and Grave Vaults. Every thing
above, on, or under the earth will be found listed in such a
volume. To grade justly all these commodities is obviously
a task of the utmost nicety. A few of the delicate questions
which have puzzled the Interstate Commerce Commission may
give some idea of the complexity of the problem.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Shall cow
peas pay freight as "vegetables, N. O. S., dried or evaporated,"
or as "fertilizer"&mdash;being an active agent in soil regeneration?
Are "iron-handled bristle shoe-blacking daubers" machinery
or toilet appliances? Are patent medicines distinguishable, for
purposes of transportation, from other alcoholic beverages used
as tonics? What is the difference, as regards rail carriage,
between a percolator and an everyday coffee pot? Are Grandpa's
Wonder Soap and Pearline&mdash;in the light of the claims
put forth by manufacturers, suitable either for laundry or
toilet purposes&mdash;to be put in different classes according to
their uses or their market price? When is a boiler not a boiler?
If it be used for heating purposes rather than steam generation,
why is it not a stove? What is the difference between raisins
and other dried fruits, unless perchance the carrier has not
yet established one industry while another is already firmly
rooted and safe against competition?</p>

<p>The classification of all these articles is a factor of primary
importance in the making of freight rates both from a public and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
private point of view. Attention has been directed of late to
its significance and importance to the private shipper, by reason
of the use made of it in the advances of freight rates which have
taken place throughout the country within the past decade.
Its public importance has not been fully appreciated until
recently as affecting the general level of railway charges. So
little was its significance understood, that supervision and
control of classification were not apparently contemplated by
the original Act to Regulate Commerce of 1887. The anomaly
existed for many years, therefore, of a grant of power intended
to regulate freight rates, which, at the same time, omitted
provision for control over a fundamentally important element
in their make-up. The Interstate Commerce Commission, however,
assumed jurisdiction over the matter: and for more than
twenty years, despite doubts expressed by the Department
of Justice as to its legality, passed upon complaints as to
unreasonable classification without protest even from the
carriers themselves. Control over it has now been assured
beyond possibility of dispute by the specific provisions of the
Hepburn Act of 1910.</p>

<p>The freight rate upon a particular commodity between any
given points is compounded of two separate and distinct
factors: one having to do with the nature of the haul, the other
with the nature of the goods themselves. Two distinct publications
must be consulted in order to determine the actual
charge. Although both of them usually bear the name of a
railway and are issued over its signature, they emanate, nevertheless,
from entirely different sources. The first of these is
known as the Freight Tariff. It specifies rates in cents per
hundred pounds for a number of different classes of freight,
numerically designated, between all the places upon each line
or its connections. Thus the tariff of the New York Central
&amp; Hudson River Railroad gives rates per hundred pounds
from New York to several hundred stations, for first, second,
third, etc., classes. This freight tariff, however, contains no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
mention whatever of commodities by name. The second
publication which must be consulted supplies this defect. This
is known as the Classification. Its function is to group all
articles more or less alike in character, so far as they affect
transportation cost, or are affected in value by carriage from
place to place. These groups correspond to the several numerical
classes already named in the freight tariff. Thus dry goods
or boots and shoes are designated as first class. Turning back
to the freight tariff, the rate from New York, for example, to
any particular place desired, for such first-class freight, is then
found in cents per hundred pounds. It thus appears, as has
been said, that a freight rate is made up of two distinct elements
equal in importance. The first is the charge corresponding
to the distance; the other is the charge as determined by the
character of the goods. Consequently, a variation in either
one of the two would result in changing the final rate as
compounded.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>A concrete illustration or two may emphasize the commercial
importance of classification. So far as it may be used to
effect an increase of rates, the following case is typical, as
given by a Boston manufacturer, in evidence before the Senate
Committee on Interstate Commerce in 1905:</p>

<p>"From July 15, 1889, to January 1, of this year, the classification
(of carbon black, basis of printers' ink) continued to
be once and a half first class in less-than-carload lots, third class
in carload lots, approximately twice the freight required between
1887 and 1889. Meanwhile, the price had declined.... On
January 1 the classification was again raised, to class 2, rule 25,
an increase of about ten per cent, in carload lots. Numerous
efforts have been made by myself and others to have this commodity
classified where it belongs, as dry color, but the only
result has been the reverse of what we desired; and the industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
has been and is in a somewhat precarious condition, as we have
contracted for millions of pounds of black at prices fixed at the
point of delivery, and had no notice of the raise in freight rate
until subsequent to its going into operation."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>The Spokane Chamber of Commerce, in these same Senate
Committee hearings, gave an illustration of the use of classification
to bring about a change of rates without modifying
the individual railway tariff. "The Pacific Coast Pipe Company
started to make wired wooden pipe in the spring of 1900....
There was at that time but one factory of the kind on
the North Pacific coast, located at Seattle.... The Seattle
factory, backed by the big lumber firms on the coast, finding
a serious competitor in the Spokane field, got the railways to
put manufactured pipe under the lumber classification, thus
reducing the rate from Seattle to Spokane from forty-six to
twenty cents per 100 pounds.... The Spokane factory at
once filed a vigorous protest, with the result that the railways
put back the rate from Seattle to Spokane to forty-six
cents, but established a maximum rate of fifty cents for Seattle
pipe, which, of course, shut off all territory east of Spokane
from the Spokane factory.... The remnant of the Spokane
factory ... has been compelled to shut down, and the entire
plant is being removed to Ballard." Whether these facts are
exactly as thus informally stated or not, is by the way. If not
done at this time, it is certain that similar manipulation of
classification rules often enters into commercial competition.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Freight tariffs and classifications are as distinct and independent
in source as they are in nature. Tariffs are issued by
each railway, by and for itself alone and upon its sole authority.
Classifications, on the other hand, do not originate with particular
railways at all; but are issued for them by co&ouml;perative
bodies, known as classification committees. These committees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>are composed of representatives from all the carriers operating
within certain designated territories. In other words, the
United States is apportioned among a number of committees,
to each of which is delegated by the carriers concerned, the
power over classification; that is to say, the right to assign
every commodity which may be shipped or received to any
particular group of freight ratings. This delegation of authority
is always subject, however, to the right of filing whatever
exceptions to the classification any railway may choose independently
to put in force. These exception sheets contain the
so-called commodity tariffs, to be subsequently described,
which stand out in sharp relief against the so-called class rates.
Such exceptions are independently filed by each railway at
Washington and do not generally form integral parts of the
volume issued by the classification committee, except in the
southern states. New editions of these classifications are
published from time to time as called for by additions or amendments,
the latest, of course, superseding all earlier ones. Thirty-seven
such issues have already appeared in series in trunk line
and southern territory, while fifty have been put forth in
western territory, since the practice was standardized in 1888.
At the present time freight classification for all the railways
of the United States is performed mainly by three committees,
known as the Official, the Southern and the Western, with
headquarters, respectively, in New York, Atlanta and Chicago.
Each of these three committees has jurisdiction over a particular
territory. Thus the Official Classification prevails east of
Chicago and north of the Ohio and the Potomac; the Southern,
over the remaining part of the country east of the Mississippi;
and the Western, throughout the rest of the United States.
In addition to these three primary classifications there is also
another, issued by the Transcontinental Freight Bureau, with
headquarters at Chicago. This committee has supervision
over classification upon the Pacific coast business. A number
of the states also, notably Illinois, Iowa and most of the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>western
commonwealths, promulgate state classifications having
relation, however, only to local business within their several
jurisdictions. These are prescribed by law and represent modifications
to suit peculiar exigencies or to foster local trade
ambitions. There are also a number of other co&ouml;perative local
railway committees, each dealing with the special concerns of
its own territory, and representing the joint interests of the
railways therein included to all the world outside. Thus, for
instance, Southern Classification territory is subdivided into
local units, known, respectively, as the Southeastern Mississippi
Valley Association, the Southeastern Freight Association, and
the Associated Railways of Virginia and the Carolinas.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> But
for all practical purposes, so far as the larger problems of classification
are concerned, our attention may be concentrated upon
the three principal committees above mentioned.</p>

<p>Some impression of the wide differences between these three
main classifications in different parts of the country may be
derived from the set of excerpts at the head of this chapter.
In three parallel columns the alpha and omega of each are
reproduced, together with bits of one of the most complicated
schedules, viz., that dealing with agricultural implements.
Even where the same commodities occur in each classification,
the diversity in description, mode of packing, carload and other
requirements, renders any direct comparison almost impossible.
The mere fact that the class assignment, as shown at the right
in each column, happens to be the same, as in the case of acetic
acid in barrels or drums which moves both in Official and
Southern Classification territory, third class in less-than-carload
lots (<i>L. C. L.</i>) and fifth class in carloads (<i>C. L.</i>), shows nothing
at all as far as equality of charges is concerned. For, as
has been said, this is only half the statement of the rate. The
spread between charges for different classes yet remains to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
determined. The actual relativity between third-class and
fifth-class rates, moreover, may be very different in the two
places. In the New York Board of Trade case<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> this point was
well exemplified. Comparative conditions as to rates in the
three main sections of the country, as they then existed, were
as follows:</p>

<p>On the trunk lines fourth-class rates were thus less than
half those charged for the first class; in the West they were
even lower, relatively; while in the South fourth-class rates
were about two-thirds as high as the first-class rates. These
differences in the spread between classes, as will be seen, interlocking
as they do with a multitude of other considerations,
are a serious bar to any partial modification in the direction
of uniformity for the United States as a whole. Only by consideration
of every factor entering into any given rate may
comparisons safely be entertained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Historically considered, the development of freight classification
has been much the same in England and the United
States. Early railway practice was an outgrowth of the tariffs
in force upon canals and toll roads.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In America, freight
charges were at the outset often arbitrarily fixed by the state
legislatures, as conditions precedent to the grant of charter.
In many instances they were based upon the customary performance
by wagon, distinguishing between light-weight
articles paying by the cubic foot, and heavy ones for which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>the tariff was based upon weight. Thus in 1827 the charter
of the South Carolina Railroad established its tolls at one
half the usual wagon charge. The Southern Pacific in local
rates on ore into San Francisco followed along just below the
charges by ox cart. The freight was proportioned also according
to the length of haul by an arbitrary mileage rate. It
soon developed, however, that railway rates were unique in
the fact that not only was there a great increase in the volume
of trade, but also in the diversity of articles offered for transportations
as well. Far more elaborate classifications were
soon seen to be necessary.</p>

<p>The South Carolina Railroad tariff of 1855, described by
McPherson,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> exemplified the primitive traffic conditions then
prevalent. Goods were divided into four classes. The first
consisted of articles of light weight or high value, including,
for example, such incongruities as bonnets, tea, and pianos.
The remaining three classes paid by weight with a descending
scale of charges. It is difficult to explain why coffee and sugar
should be rated lower than stoves and feathers; or why dry
hides and rice should be charged a higher rate than cotton
yarn and bacon; but it is evident that a rough classification
according to weight, value, use and cost of service was being
attempted. There was in addition a considerable collection
of special rates on chosen commodities according to the method
of packing them, whether by barrel, bale or case. And there
were also what corresponded to modern commodity rates upon
cordwood, lumber, bricks, and similar goods. This tariff,
though primitive, including no less than three hundred items,
was far more elaborate than those commonly used at the time.
The Louisville &amp; Nashville originally distinguished but three
classes: one by bulk, another by weight and a third applicable
to live stock. Poultry was rated by the dozen long after
the Civil War, with a higher charge for Muscovy than for
ordinary ducks. The traffic manager of the Chicago, Milwaukee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>&amp; St. Paul testified before the Elkins committee in
1905, that the classification in Illinois in his youth was printed
on the back of a bill of lading no greater than the size of an
ordinary sheet of letter paper, and the page was not full.</p>

<p>From these modest beginnings the development of classification
in the United States was rapid, responding to the
ever-increasing intensity of competition and the spread of
markets, particularly after 1875. By the middle of the eighties
most of the large railways were working under six or eight
different classifications. It began to be apparent that some
check must be placed upon such increasing complexity. For
conditions were wellnigh intolerable, with one set of rules
for Illinois, and yet another west of Buffalo, divided into
eastbound and westbound sections, with still a third on westward
shipments local to territory between Chicago and the
Missouri river. The first attempt at a systematic scheme was
made in 1882, but the agreements then made proved unstable.
By 1887 conditions had become insupportable, so great was the
number and the diversity of the classifications throughout the
country.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Some applied to local business only, and were peculiar
to each road. Some applied only to westbound business,
others to eastbound traffic. The traffic manager of the New
York Central &amp; Hudson River testified before the Interstate
Commerce Commission that there were at one time 138 distinct
classifications in trunk line territory alone. The case of the
Wabash in 1883 was typical. A shipper desiring to determine
freight rates over that road might be compelled to consult a
classification for the middle and western states in six classes;
one for the Southern Railway &amp; Steamship Association
territory in eighteen classes; one for Mississippi valley business
in five classes; one known as the Revised Western in nine
classes; the Trunk Line East in thirteen classes; the Trunk
Line West in five classes; a classification for Texas points in
eight classes; and two for the Pacific coast, according to direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>in eight and nine classes, respectively. This situation,
rendering it almost impossible for any shipper to determine
in advance what his freight rates were going to be, as well as
what his competitor was paying, early impressed itself upon
the Interstate Commerce Commission. And it was doubtless
due in part to its initiative that classifications were shaken
down into substantially their present general form in 1888.</p>

<p>The natural growth of classification in a rapidly developing
country like the United States, has manifested itself in
three distinct ways: there has been a steady increase in the
number of items of freight separately enumerated; a growing
distinction in rates between carload and less-than-carload
shipments; and a steadily enlarging volume of the most elaborate
special rules and descriptions. As for the mere increase
in distinct commodities enumerated, in the East in 1886 there
had come to be about 1,000. The first Official Classification
in the following year increased to 2,800 items; and by 1893,
in the eleventh issue, there were twice that number. The
latest Official Classification, No. 34 in 1909, contained approximately
6,000 separate enumerations&mdash;not many more, in
fact, than fifteen years earlier. The point of saturation, or
else the limit of human ingenuity, seems to have been about
reached some years ago. The same thing was true of the
Western Classification. In 1893 this contained 3,658 items,
representing an increase of about 2,000 over the number of
commodities classified by name in 1886. By 1909, as the
above figures show, it comprehended 5,729, almost as many
separate items, in fact, for less-than-carload lots as were recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
in trunk line territory. Only in carload ratings is the
Western Classification less extensive. The Southern Classification
reflected somewhat simpler trade conditions prevalent
south of the Ohio river, by the relatively smaller
number of articles enumerated; but it should be added
that the number of exceptions&mdash;filling no less than 160
pages in the latest issue&mdash;is indicative throughout of a lesser
degree of standardization than is found elsewhere. Perhaps
the most striking feature of the southern system is the very
small proportion of carload rates. But it should be noted
in this connection that the basing point system afforded preference
to market towns in any event; so that jobbers in such
places did not need wholesale rates to the same degree. This
phase of the matter will be elsewhere discussed.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The second natural tendency in the development of classification
above mentioned, is an increase in the number of
separate ratings for large and small shipments. The normal
growth of trade ought to make possible a steady increase
in shipments by the carload, rather than by the box, barrel,
or case; and the increase in the number of separate carload
ratings&mdash;always, of course, at a reduced rate by comparison
with less-than-carload lots&mdash;conforms territorially to the
growth in the volume of trade. In 1877, even in trunk line
territory, only twenty-four commodities were accorded a special
carload rate.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> By 1880 the number had increased to 50, and
seven years later to 160. Just before the passage of the Act
to Regulate Commerce there was no distinction between carload
and small lots in eighty-five per cent. of the articles enumerated.
A sudden change supervened in the first Official
Classification issued after the Federal Act. The number of
carload ratings was suddenly raised to 900, provoking a storm
of protest from eastern shippers who resented this advantage
accorded to jobbers in the West and South, because it enabled
the latter to buy their supplies directly at wholesale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>The dispute between dealers in the older and newer commercial
centres came to a head in the so-called New York Board
of Trade and Transportation case of 1888, elsewhere discussed.
Yet notwithstanding this protest of jobbers and manufacturers
in eastern trade centres, who insisted that they should be
permitted to compete on even terms with provincial jobbers
by making their shipments direct from New York or Boston
in small lots as cheaply as the local jobber could buy them by
the carload, the number of separate carload ratings steadily
augmented year after year. By 1893 more than half of the
articles enumerated in the Official Classification were allowed
a lower rate for large shipments. Present conditions are set
forth by the statistics in the preceding paragraph. From
these it appears that in trunk line territory nearly three-fourths
of the commodities now enjoy carload ratings; while
in the South, on the other hand, only about one-fifth of them
make such distinction between carload and less-than-carload
lots.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> One reason is evident; namely, that throughout a large
part of the South few jobbers command a business of sufficient
magnitude to make use of carload shipments. It is but recently,
to take a specific illustration, that business has developed
in volume sufficient to permit of the shipment of
fly paper in carload lots. Until such time no distinction
between large and small shipments could well be made.</p>

<p>Conditions in the West, according to these figures, are
intermediate between those in the East and the South. On
the other hand, transcontinental business, as carried on in
competition with ocean steamers, is almost entirely confined to
shipment by the carload. The Transcontinental Classification
is unique, therefore, in offering but very few opportunities
for shipment by package, except under specially onerous conditions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>
<p>The spread, in other words, between the two sorts
of carriage operates most unfavorably by contrast upon the
intermountain centres. Denver, for example, under the Western
Classification enjoys no carload rates, while competitors
at San Francisco have a large number.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>A much more elaborate code of rules and regulations having
reference to local practices and conditions is the third accompaniment
of the growth of trade.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Prior to 1887, and again
before the recent revival of interest in uniform classification,
conditions had become intolerable in this regard. All sorts
of details, covering relatively unimportant differences in conditions
of carriage, bill of lading contracts, marking and packing,
led to constant confusion and annoyance, especially in
cases of shipment from one classification territory to another.
An eastern shipper of iron bolts, having in mind that a gunny
sack is equivalent to a box or barrel in the East, orders a small
shipment in a bag to a far western point. He finds that bolts
in bags under the rules of the Western Classification, are
specially enumerated only for carload lots, and that he must
pay a rate one class higher for such shipment than if contained
in a barrel, box or keg. This difference in classification may
more than absorb his profit. Recent evidence before the
Interstate Commerce Commission,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> contained a striking illustration
of such local diversity in rules and descriptions as
applied to furniture.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Western class</i>: 'Bank, store, saloon and office furniture, consisting
of arm rails, back bar mirrors, bottle cases, chairs, counter-fittings,
desk, foot rails, metal brackets for arm and foot rails, refrigerators,
tables and work boards. Note&mdash;Door, window and bar screens,
partitions, prescription cases, patent medicine cases, show cases, wall-cases,
wainscoting, office railing and wooden mantels may be shipped
with bank, store, saloon or office furniture in mixed carloads at third-class,
minimum weight 12,000 lbs.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<p>"There is no such provision as this in the Official Classification.
On the contrary, a shipment of that kind can only be made by figuring
out the less-than-carload rate on each article, many of which take first,
double first and even three times first ratings.</p>

<p>"For example, mirrors over five feet in length are classified double
first class in the official classification, while show cases, set up, take
three times first. The natural result of this difference in classification
has been to shut out competition of eastern dealers in these articles
entirely in Western Classification territory."</p></div>

<p>Only in a customs tariff of the United States would one expect
to find any such complexity as is discoverable in railway
documents of this sort.</p>

<p>The mere interpretation of such classification rules is often
difficult; especially with reference to the mode of packing.
Suppose a tariff provides a certain rate on stamped metal
ware in boxes, barrels or crates and, furthermore, fixes the
charge fifty per cent, higher for shipment in bales, bags or
bundles. If the consignment is encased in corrugated straw-board,
which of the two rates applies? The difference in rates
being so great, it becomes quite an item on a shipment of
fifteen carloads from Buffalo to the Pacific coast.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Or it may
be a question as to whether a crate for Colorado cantaloupes
is actually of such dimensions as to come in under a specially
favorable commodity rate.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>The growing diversification of manufactures and trade is,
of course, responsible for all three of the developments above
indicated. Not only the increasing refinement of commerce,
but the technical nomenclature or trade jargon, necessary for
the specific and accurate description of so many thousands
of articles, have conspired to render these documents extremely
cumbersome in the absence of a general revision and simplification.
It is but natural that one item after another should
be added, each bearing a particular name or being classified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>upon some new basis. A striking example of this increase of
complexity was afforded by the cotton goods schedule in the
Southern Classification. By 1900 there were upwards of
thirty different names under which cotton cloth might be
shipped. Great complaint was occasioned, as well as the
possibility of fraud, by underclassification, etc. Most of these
thirty names did not represent different values of goods, but
in many instances were merely trade-marks of particular
manufacturers. At the urgent request of the shippers this
complicated schedule was superseded in 1900 by one comprehensive
title of "cotton goods in the piece" irrespective of
color, particular method of weaving or other subordinate
details.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the point of view of economic theory, the warrant
for a differentiation of charges between various classes of
commodities offered for transportation, may be considered
primarily from two distinct points of view. The first is that
of operation, which determines cost. The second is from the
standpoint of traffic whereby the value of service, so-called, is
measured. The reasonableness of making a distinction in
freight rates according to the character of goods is easily
apparent, as judged on the basis of cost of service. A multitude
of factors enter into consideration at this point. The
railway ought in self-protection to charge more for hauling
a thing, if it actually costs it more in the long run to perform
that service. Some of the factors which enter into this cost
were well put by the Interstate Commerce Commission in
1897.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Whether commodities were crude, rough, or finished; liquid or
dry; knocked down or set up; loose or in bulk; nested or in boxes,
or otherwise packed; if vegetables, whether green or dry, desiccated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>or evaporated; the market value and shippers' representations as to
their character; the cost of service, length and direction of haul; the
season and manner of shipment; the space occupied and weight;
whether in carload or less-than-carload lots; the volume of annual
shipments to be calculated on; the sort of car required, whether flat,
gondola, box, tank, or special; whether ice or heat must be furnished;
the speed of trains necessary for perishable or otherwise rush goods; the
risk of handling, either to the goods themselves or other property;
the weights, actual and estimated; the carrier's risk or owner's release
from damage or loss."</p></div>

<p>Instances of approval of classification on the basis of such
cost of operation are frequently found in the decisions of the
Interstate Commerce Commission. For example, special service
or equipment, as in the rapid transport of fresh vegetables
and fruit from the South, justify the carriers in a specially
high classification.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Rates on live hogs by comparison with
rates on hog products, as well as on live cattle and dressed
beef, have likewise been adjusted in terms of cost of carriage.
A classification on hogs yielding a rate equal to two-thirds of
that on hog products has been held equitably to represent
the relative expense.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Even the indefinite element of risk
has been accepted as justifying a higher classification for live
stock as compared with other commodities.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Classification is less easy to defend from the standpoint of
the traffic manager alone, than from that of the vice-president
in charge of operation. Value of service is at times difficult
to understand. It is not at first sight reasonable, that of two
commodities which cost the railway exactly the same amount
to transport, one should be charged twice as much as the
other. For example, the rate on anthracite coal is very much
higher than upon soft coal; the rate upon wheat is higher than
the rate upon some other foodstuffs; the rate upon fine woollen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>goods is very much higher than upon coarse cotton cloth, etc.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
It has been urged frequently that any discrimination in the
freight rate on the basis of difference, either in the value of
the commodity itself or in the value of the service rendered,
is unreasonable and unjust. The case, however, is entirely
analogous to that of discrimination between a long and short
haul of the same goods. The principle is perfectly defensible
in both cases, and has been accepted in legal decisions as well
as by economic writers for many years. It is based upon the
fact, which confronts one at every turn in a discussion of railway
economics, that a large proportion of the expenses of a
railway is independent of the amount of traffic. These fixed
expenses must be met at all cost if the road is to remain solvent.
They constitute a charge upon the entire traffic of the line,
and are not susceptible of apportionment to each unit of transportation.
Any rate which will contribute a surplus, small or
large, above the mere cost of transportation,&mdash;that is to say,
above the expenses incident to this particular carriage,&mdash;and
which thereby lessens by the amount of that excess the burden
of the fixed charges remaining upon other traffic, is justifiable.
But it is defensible only under two conditions. The first is
that the goods at any higher rate will go by another route or
not at all; and the second is that the effect may not be detrimental
to the general course of business,&mdash;that is to say, that
it is not opposed to the public welfare. Thus a long haul at a
lower rate than the rate charged for a shorter haul, if it must
be lower in order to secure the business, constitutes no injustice
to the local shipper; for the surplus remaining above
the cost of haulage of that particular increment of freight
lessens thereby the charge which must be made upon local
freight for meeting interest on bonds, maintenance of way,
and equipment expenses, etc., all of which charges, as we have
seen, go on more or less independently of the traffic. On
precisely the same grounds a discrimination of freight rates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>in favor of the cheaper commodity or the less valuable service
may be defended. Coal or sand may reasonably be carried
at two and one-fourth mills per ton mile, while the road is
coincidently charging three or four times as much for hauling
dry goods or fine hardware. For if a quarter of a mill per ton
mile can be earned above the expenses incident to hauling
that sand or coal, it enables the rates on the dry goods or
hardware to be maintained at a lower point than they otherwise
would be. It is unnecessary to elaborate this principle
further. It is everywhere accepted as valid. And it in a
measure substantiates Mavor's statement that "freight rates,
like rent, are rather the effect of price movements than the
cause of them." When tariffs are high because prices are
high, we are afforded a fair illustration of value of service as
an element in rate making.</p>

<p>Value of service, therefore, as affording a warrant for
classification, has also been recognized in a number of Interstate
Commerce decisions since 1887. A relation between
the grade of the charge and fluctuations in the market price
of the commodity&mdash;in other words, charging what the traffic
will bear&mdash;is at times discernible. It is to the interest of the
public that carriers should be satisfied with relatively smaller
profits from the transportation of commodities of low price
which are in general demand.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Under these circumstances
changes in price of such staple commodities as iron and steel
or the lower priced grains, should be reflected in a corresponding
modification of rates.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Akin to this is recognition of a
relation in general between the value of a commodity and its
classification. Where, for example, articles representing different
stages of manufacture have to be graded, it is but fair that
the raw material, or the partly-made product should be graded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>lower than the finished article.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Similarly, articles which may
fairly be substituted for one another ought to be classified with
reference to their common market value.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> The relative value
of commodities, as controlling classification, clearly governs
the treatment of hard and soft coal.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The practical difficulty,
of course, is to know where to stop in admitting such considerations.
Shall "small-vein" soft coal, because it cannot
compete on even terms with the "big-vein" product, be accepted
for carriage on a more favored basis?<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Some rather
nice questions, both of business and public policy, would be
suggested by such a precedent.</p>

<p>Different classification of the same commodity according
to the use to which it may be put, is evidently an attempt to
grade according to value rather than cost of service. Automobile
parts may come in from the wheel-maker at second-class
rates, but when they go out to jobbing houses they are
rated three times first class.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> A number of cases of this sort
have come before the Commission. Shall cow peas, for example,
be classed with corn and oats as agricultural products
in one case, while according them a rating with commercial
fertilizers in another, inasmuch as they may become an active
agent in nitrogenizing soil?<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> More recently the Commission
has declined to recognize the validity of classification on this
basis. Thus brick is always to be charged the same without
regard to whether it is for fire, building or paving purposes.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
Unusually low rates for steam coal used by carriers and open
only to certain shippers for this or other particular purposes,
likewise have been forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The carriers have attempted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>to distinguish in grade between dried fruit and raisins. For
the two industries call for relatively different protection against
old-established competitors.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>As actually effected in practice, classification of freight
seems to have been largely empirical&mdash;the result of long experience
in sympathetically feeling the pulse of the business
community. In the main, despite their denial of the validity
of cost as an element in rate making, traffic managers and the
Interstate Commerce Commission seem to have been swayed
more commonly by this consideration in the make-up of schedules.
Nevertheless, charging what the traffic will bear, as a
principle, will suffice alone to explain many of the details of
classification now in force. Rates have been adjusted so as
to secure the largest amount of business possible at the highest
rate compatible with that volume. In other words, traffic
managers have been mainly influenced by the consideration
well stated by a witness before the United States Industrial
Commission: that, "a freight tariff is made as it is, not because
it ought to be that, but because it must be that." The procedure
of classification committees seems, in other words, to
have been mainly based upon considerations of revenue, and
that, too, without any very positive evidence as to details.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
Rule-of-thumb experience, therefore, is mainly represented
in classifications of the present time; that is to say, an adjustment
of freight rates upon different commodities to suit the
commercial conditions which have happened to prevail at
any given time. All of which emphasizes still further the
need of scientific revision of these most important schedules,
preferably by the carriers themselves, but by public authority
if commercial inertia be too powerful to be overcome.</p>

<p>The spread of a classification,&mdash;that is to say, the graduation
of rates as between all kinds of goods, from fine silks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>to lime and sand, or from aeroplanes, "set up," to pig iron,
"knocked down,"&mdash;is not constant. How shall this be theoretically
justified? At first sight it would appear as if the
relativity of charges between different things, as determined
by cost or value of service, ought to remain fixed; that is to
say, for example, that rates on raw hides fairly standing at
one-half of the charge for shoes, ought to remain always and
everywhere at this ratio. Advocates of a rigid classification
prescribed by public authority seem often to assume that this
could be brought about. But a moment's consideration of
the nature of a tariff as it has already been described will show
that this is impossible. The spread or gradation, far from
being fixed, must in the nature of things ever vary from place
to place with change of trade conditions. The rate on raw
hides relatively to that on shoes in New England&mdash;the centre
of manufacture for footwear&mdash;should be very different at
Kansas City or Chicago, whence the raw hides are derived:
different alone, if for no other reason than because hides,
moving east, progressively add the cost of carriage the farther
they go; while with shoes the augmentation of value goes on
in the opposite direction, geographically. True as between
commodities, the same inconstancy of ratio also holds good as
between different points along a given line. The rate from New
York to Durham, North Carolina, for example, on first-class
freight may be fifteen per cent. above that for freight of the second
class; the second class maybe twenty per cent. above that of
third class for this distance, etc.; yet the divergence between
these same classes for another distance, as between New York
and Jacksonville, Florida, may be quite different,&mdash;twenty
per cent. between first and second class, twenty-seven per cent.
between second and third, and so on. This is indeed rather a
difficult matter to understand.</p>

<p>This ever-changing spread of rates from place to place, as
between different commodities and with all possible combinations
of the two, may be clearly explained by reference to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
diagram at page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>, showing the gradation of charges by
distance for different goods. Is it not plain that the spread
between commodities at any given place is indicated by taking
a vertical cross section of the diagram at that point? We
have already seen that the curves, rising with increase of the
distance, do so by different degrees. They cross and recross,
making an intricate lace work of lines, because of the fact that
while cost, in general, may increase more or less proportionately
to distance, competition in its ever-varying forms, plays all
sorts of pranks with the rates from point to point. The rate
at any station is shown by the height of the curve on the
vertical line for that place. Even, however, if the curves never
crossed, but rose by evenly spraying out from the point of
shipment at one end of the line, as in the case of those for the
three upper classes, their relative heights would constantly
change with distance. But owing to the complexities of competition
the onward and upward movement of the curves for
particular commodities is usually much more erratic than this.
Some goods, like children, "get their growth" early. They
soon attain the level of all the charge they can ever bear.
Others distribute their development over a much greater
distance. Sometimes, as we have observed, the coal curve
will be above the wheat curve; sometimes it will be below.
In other words, the vagaries of these sloping lines cause the
vertical cross sections, indicative of spread, to vary from point
to point all along the line. Such a thing as constancy of ratio
between classes or particular goods is, in the nature of transportation
things, impossible. This is a matter of fundamental
importance, especially in its bearing upon the proposition,
soon to be considered, of substituting a single uniform classification
under government authority for the present threefold
system. Moreover, it demonstrates the great commercial
disturbance which might ensue from a general advance of
freight rates by an indiscriminate transfer of commodities from
lower to higher classes, such as was attempted in 1900. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
procedure is altogether illogical, and economically as upsetting
to trade as a general "horizontal" increase or reduction of a
customs tariff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Commodity rates as a means for enabling shippers to reach
beyond their immediate territory and gain an entrance to
new markets, form an entirely distinct variety of charges from
those quoted in the classified tariffs. These are special rates
made to suit particular contingencies,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> although, of course,
under the law they must be filed with the Interstate Commerce
Commission in the same manner. Such commodity
rates, however, do not apply to persons but to localities. Although
granted to shippers in a particular place to build up
an industry, the privilege of shipment under the same conditions
is theoretically open, of course, to all others at that
point. Such commodity rates naturally apply to three sets
of commercial conditions: they either govern large shipments
for long distances, as in the case of live stock; or, if for short
distances, they are confined to commodities of the very lowest
grade, such as lime, sand or paving blocks; or else they are introduced
to meet special conditions, such as an irregular market or
rapidly fluctuating competitive circumstances, as in the case
of goods for import or export. Such special rates are almost
invariably granted for carload lots alone. The reason is,
naturally, that it would not be worth while to make an exception
to the classified schedules for less than that amount.
Moreover, it should be observed, special rates of this sort are
often introduced in order to meet changeable competition,
such as by steamship lines engaged in export or import business.
The classified ratings change but little, and oftentimes remain
the same for many years. But in all cases where fluctuating
conditions have to be met, commodity rates by the carload
are likely to appear. This is one reason why the transcontinental
tariffs, exposed to competition either by the Cape Horn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>or Panama water routes, contain so large a proportion of
commodity or carload ratings.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Exceptional or commodity rates are also commonly found
in a territory like the southern states, where manufactures
are struggling to maintain a foothold. If it appear that a
new industry can maintain itself in competition with already
established industries elsewhere only by a concession in charges,
the traffic manager may elect to grant a commodity rate until
such time as the industry has been placed firmly upon its feet.
The tonnage moving under commodity rates in such circumstances
may be much greater than that included under the
classified schedules. Attention has already been drawn to
this fact, but it merits still further comment. Probably three-fourths
of the business of American railways is done under
such special rates. This is apparently a higher proportion
than rules in foreign countries with the possible exception of
England. Yet it is important to notice that the revenue
obtained from such traffic is relatively much less than the tonnage,
inasmuch as most commodity rates are confined to low-grade
goods. Whether such exceptions to the classified tariffs
are on the increase or not is open to question. The evidence
tends to show that special rates granted in connection with
industrial development tend to increase up to a certain point.
Commodity rates, for example, are said to be much more important
in the West than they were fifteen years ago.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> But,
on the other hand, industrial conditions having once become
standardized and assured, the natural disposition of the railways
is to substitute regular schedules for a multiplicity of special
rates. The dilemma is that such a special rate once allowed,
is exceedingly difficult to withdraw. An earnest attempt was
made by the trunk lines in 1899 to retire a large number of
these commodity rates. It then appeared that the New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad had no less than 1,370 on
file. Opposition naturally arose to the cancellation of these&mdash;an
opposition less easily overcome because of the complication
that the withdrawal of commodity rates meant practically
the abolition of carload ratings. Such action, therefore, looking
toward simplification of tariffs, threatened substantially
to disturb all the existing commercial adjustments. Nevertheless
it is encouraging to note that a distinct reduction in the
number of separate and independent rates put into effect is
apparent since the recent extensions of Federal authority. The
following table, covering the tariffs officially filed at Washington
since 1906, is proof positive of great improvement in this regard:</p>

<p>A reduction of more than one half within five years is matter
for public congratulation.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Special or commodity rates for the maintenance of equilibrium
between competing markets fall naturally into several
distinct groups.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> In the first of these, concerning commodity
rates on grain and grain products and cotton, production takes
place over a vast extent of territory and the products are
marketed in places widely remote from one another. The
problem under such circumstances is mainly that of securing
equalization through different gateways.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In the case of
wheat it is a question first of concentration at primary markets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>such as St. Paul, Kansas City, or Chicago; and thereafter of
carriage by competitive routes whether by the way of the Gulf, by
any of the various Atlantic seaports or by the St. Lawrence
River. Commodity rates are thus determined in this first
class of cases mainly with references to competition of routes.
On the other hand, when production is spread over a considerable
territory, but when transportation is thereafter effected
along converging lines to a fairly localized centre of manufacture,
the problem of equalizing conditions, competitively,
by the resort to commodity rates, has mainly to do with competitive
conditions at the place of production. Rates on wool
to the highly localized markets of the world afford illustration
of this second type of commodity rate problem.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Commodity
rates upon fruits and vegetables to common markets
from such widely separated sources of supply as Florida
and California or the equilibration of conditions of production
for coal or lumber from the most widely scattered
sources of supply, are perhaps the most difficult of all to
settle satisfactorily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The amount of reduction to be allowed on shipments by
carload as against consignments in small lots is a nice and most
perplexing problem in classification. Attention has already
been directed to the great increase in distinct carload ratings
which has accompanied the development of trade. As affecting
the interests of shippers in different parts of the country, the
question came up almost immediately after the passage of the
Act to Regulate Commerce. In the so-called New York Board
of Trade case,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> complaint was entered by eastern merchants
against a great increase in the number of wholesale ratings in
1888. More than five times as many commodities as before
were abruptly given lower rates when shipped out of New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>by the carload. Inasmuch as a very large proportion of groceries
and other supplies went by box or package, this reduction
accorded on carload shipments greatly benefited the jobbers
all through the West and South. Under new conditions provincial
middlemen could buy in carloads; and then re-distribute
from local centres much more advantageously than
before. The Commission, called upon to decide as to the
relative rights of these two classes of jobbers, attempted to
bring about an adjustment which should, in the main, conform
to the existing trade conditions; and yet should take into
consideration the relative cost of service in the two cases. The
competitive struggle between eastern and both southern and
western dealers revealed in these early proceedings, has cropped
out continually in official proceedings ever since that time.
In a modified form the same question came to the front in connection
with the general advance of freight rates in 1900.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
The changes at this time were twofold&mdash;not only modifications
in the number of carload ratings, but also an altered
differential or spread between the charges for the two sorts of
shipments. The question is a vital one to all the shipping
interests of the country. It is one of the most troublesome
elements in the establishment of a uniform classification for the
United States as a whole. For inability to standardize reasonable
differences between carload and small shipments, under
the widely different trade conditions and practices in various
sections of the country, is an almost insuperable difficulty in
the way of that reform.</p>

<p>The economic justice of allowing a carload shipper lower
rates than one who ships in small lots is apparent, on account
of the difference in the cost of such service to the railways.
This has been recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission
and the courts as beyond question. Not only the amount
of paying freight in relation to dead weight; but the cost of
loading and unloading, of billing or collection and of adjusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
damages&mdash;all of these elements of cost are noticeably less in the
case of a full carload. Turning from these considerations of
cost to those prescribed by what may be called traffic principles,
the difficulty in arriving at a just determination may be easily
appreciated. Glass battery jars in less-than-carload lots were
at one time charged from New York to Atlanta, Georgia,
second-class rates, namely ninety-eight cents per one hundred
pounds. The same commodity when in carload shipments
(not less than 20,000 pounds) was rated as fifth class; in which
case the charge from New York to Atlanta became sixty cents.
Here was a plain difference of thirty-eight cents per one hundred
pounds&mdash;upward of sixty per cent. greater charge&mdash;to the
small shipper whose business or capital was insufficient to
warrant shipments to such an amount. Two results of such
discrimination are possible. In the first place, the large shipper
is enabled to undersell his smaller competitor and perhaps to
drive him out of that class of business. This may take place
as between two dealers, both located in the South and buying
their supplies from New York. The second result is that under
such rates it is impossible for the manufacturer or northern
jobber to sell direct from New York to the retailer in the South
in competition with the provincial jobber there located, who
ships his goods in at the cheap carload rate and distributes
them thereafter. The problem thus concerns at the same time
both the small local shipper or dealer, as against a more formidable
provincial competitor; and also the remote jobbers
as a class against the whole group of local middlemen. In the
latter case, sometimes, as in the South, the question is still
further complicated by a basing point system, under which
the provincial jobber re-distributes to the country stores the
goods which have already been shipped in on a low carload
rate.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> And, locally, there is also the immanence in the South
of water competition by sea and river to be kept in mind.
Boat charges are based upon space requirements rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>weight. This introduces further important considerations in
fixing the spread of charges.</p>

<p>The problem as it affects the manufacturer is akin to that
concerning the jobber. Originally, as a matter of fact, the carload
reduction was essentially a manufacturers' rating, especially
for goods in which the cost of raw material formed a
large part of the price of the finished product. The relations
of the carload rate on the former to the less-than-carload rate
on the latter, it is obvious, may readily become an important
element in industrial success. It is plain enough that carload
charges under such circumstances should be substantially less
than those upon small consignments; but that is far from
affording a satisfactory answer to the question as to the
proper spread or difference in charge to be allowed between
the two.</p>

<p>Obviously, in any representation as to the reasonableness of
the discount which shall be allowed on carloads, either on the
basis of cost or of traffic principles, the interests of localities
are commercially pitted one against another. The New York
or Chicago jobbing house desiring to sell its goods directly to
the retailers throughout the West, wishes to have a relatively
low rate on such small shipments as the retailers in lesser
places alone can afford to purchase. Participation in this
distributing business, however, is resented by the middlemen
located in western centres&mdash;Omaha, Denver, Kansas City,
etc.&mdash;who all insist that there should be so wide a difference
between carload and less-than-carload rates that they may
ship in their wholesale purchases at a low rate, and thus compete
in their own territory with the manufacturer in the East or
the jobber in New York who desires to sell direct.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Comparison
of the classifications in different parts of the country reveals
the influence of these local interests. The railways in Official
Classification territory desire, of course, to build up the manufacturing
and jobbing cities tributary to them. This can best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>be done by encouraging the growth of eastern jobbing centres,
stimulated by as low rates for retail as for wholesale shipments.
The railways in the western and southern territory, on the
contrary, are obliged to consider the claims of their constituents,
and to correspondingly minimize the advantages which foreign
competitors of their local wholesale dealers enjoy. Another
consideration must also be kept in view, namely, that carload
ratings can only be accorded when business has developed a
magnitude sufficient to permit shipments of that size. The
growth of the volume of business in general, therefore, might
be normally expected to produce an increase in the proportion
of carload ratings. Experience, as we have seen, confirms this
view. The normal development, then, is toward an increase
in the number of lower rates quoted for carload lots. This is
retarded only by the influence of the jobbers and manufacturers
in the eastern trade centres, who insist that they shall be permitted
to compete on even terms with provincial middlemen
by making their shipments direct in small lots at rates approximately
as low as the local jobbers pay on carload lots. This
question is an exceedingly important one, requiring the balance
of opposing interests to a nicety.</p>

<p>Not unfamiliar aspects of the problem of carload rating are
revealed in a recent case before the Interstate Commerce Commission,
concerning milk rates in New England.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> And yet the
normal order is reversed. Usually, complaint is made of the
denial of carload ratings. In this instance a plea was entered
for a useable small unit rate as against the wholesale charge.
The dispute was precipitated by a deadlock in 1910 between
the three large Boston milk contractors and the farmers'
associations of several states. The producers, failing in their
demand for an increased price, declined to furnish milk at the
old figure. A famine resulted, which drew the attention of
the public sharply to the system under which the Metropolitan
district of Boston was supplied. The belief prevailed that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>peculiar transportation conditions known as the "leased car
system" which had existed for half a century, was mainly
responsible for the tight monopoly of the milk supply. Under
this arrangement specially low charges were allowed to those
who made shipments regularly by the carload. The Massachusetts
legislature, after an investigation, finally passed a law
providing that no carrier should charge more for the transportation
of milk by the can than was charged for larger quantities;
and also that the same facilities, icing, for example, should be
furnished in the one case as in the other. This settled the
intrastate charges; but it left matters as before for all the other
New England states contributing to the market. In this
form the controversy was brought before the Federal authorities,
which exhaustively considered the methods of transportation
as affecting all parties concerned. The contrast with the older
elastic situation as to milk ratings in New York was sharp in
many respects.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> This earlier controversy had to do mainly
with the relative rights of nearby and distant producers. It
was a question of the element of distance as affecting a local or
territorial monopoly. The Boston case, on the other hand,
was rather a matter of carload ratings than of graduation of
charges according to the length of the haul. The monopoly in
this instance was that of contractors who had succeeded in
getting entire control of the business by reason of the wide
spread between charges for milk by the can and by the "leased
car." Shipments by the can from the independent farmer
were rendered practically impossible since they had to be
carried in the baggage car and were liable to spoil through
lack of refrigeration.</p>

<p>By contrast with the New York "open car system," the
New England plan from the standpoint of cost of service alone
seemed to offer several advantages. A caretaker, hired by
the milk contractor and in constant personal touch with the
farmers, exercised supervision both over milk and cans; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
insured a heavier loading and more prompt service at terminals;
resulted in the operators providing the best facilities for handling
the supply; and allowed surplus milk to be directed to
other uses without waste. A large investment had been made
under this system, dependent upon its continuance for a reasonable
return. On the other hand, denial of equally low rates
with the same facilities for refrigeration to the single-can
shipper, had undoubtedly fostered monopoly. The railways,
conforming to the new Massachusetts law above mentioned,
offered to furnish and operate a car suitable for independent
shippers on condition that six hundred cans should be tendered
for shipment. But they denied obligation to furnish icing
facilities, which latter, of course, were absolutely necessary for
the success of the competitive service. To be sure, the leased
car controlled by the contractors had been theoretically open
to all, on condition of a small charge for icing; but the farmers
contended that independent shippers ought not to be compelled
thus to deliver over their property into the hands of
competitors, with the accompanying exposure of their business
relations. In the light of all these complications the Commission
decided that a <i>per</i> can rate with the necessary refrigeration,
and bearing a proper relation to the carload rate,
ought to be established. And there the matter rests at this
time.</p>

<p>The problem of mixed carloads, also, is a difficult one to
adjust to the needs of primary and secondary distributing
points.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> It is oftentimes of vital importance to a small jobber
to be able to make up a carload of miscellaneous packages. His
business may not be large enough to permit him to enjoy the
advantage of a carload rate on any single commodity. Or the
independent meat packer may be greatly benefited by a rule
which permits him to bulk his soap and other by-products
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>with other goods in securing a wholesale rate. Why may a
paper manufacturer not combine paper bags and wrapping
paper in one territory as well as another? In this regard the
rules in the West and South are naturally much less liberal
than in the East. The privilege of mixture has been given
only to a limited extent to jobbing and manufacturing centres
by means of commodity tariffs. Such mixture is usually restricted
to analogous articles, such as agricultural implements,
furniture or commodities intended to serve a joint purpose.
The recent bitter protest against the discontinuance of the
right to ship binder twine with agricultural implements is a
case in point. On the other hand, eastern railways are a unit
in opposing the bulking of separate shipments in carloads when
owned by different shippers. The western and southern roads
do not specially forbid it. All such differences come to the fore
in any attempt to unify the practice of all the carriers of the
country under a single set of regulations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Assuming the reasonableness of a difference in charges between
carload and small shipments, where shall the dividing
line as to size be drawn? This is the important and perplexing
problem of minimum carload rates. Turning to our excerpt
from the Western Classification on page <a href="#Page_298">298</a>, it appears that
24,000 pounds of advertising matter, N. O. S. (not otherwise
specified), must be shipped at one time in order to warrant a
carload rate. Under such circumstances a consignment of
20,000 pounds would be classified first instead of third class&mdash;the
difference in rate varying according to distance, but in all
cases being substantial. Between St. Louis and St. Joseph,
Missouri, for example, the charge would be sixty instead of
thirty-five cents per hundredweight. Were the minimum
weight for carloads but 15,000 pounds, as in the case of harvesters
under the Southern Classification, this particular shipment
of advertising matter would have enjoyed the full benefit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
wholesale charges.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> From this instance it is apparent that the
point at which the minimum carload weight falls, is of great
importance in the determination of the actual rate&mdash;an importance
also dependent, of course, upon the spread between
carload and less-than-carload charges. It is also evident that
minimum carload ratings may readily be used as a means of
advancing charges. If, as appeared in a recent case,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> the minimum
carload for wool in sacks was advanced between 1896 and
1912 from 15,000 to 20,000 pounds, the effect upon the shipper
of a consignment of 18,000 pounds, for example, would be as
truly an increase of charges as if the freight rates themselves
had been actually advanced. For under the new schedule, he
would be compelled to pay less-than-carload charges instead
of the lower carload rates formerly granted. Moreover, it is
apparent that minimum carload weights may enter seriously
into commercial competition in a number of ways. If 45,000
pounds of raw cotton by a special round-bale process can be
loaded upon a standard car; when but 25,000 pounds of the
ordinary square bales could be carried by the same equipment;
it is evident that tariffs based upon the higher minimum would
especially favor one set of competitors as against another.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
They might, in fact, be sufficient to turn the scale entirely in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>favor of the round-bale system throughout the South. Granted,
however, that such heavy loading makes for economy in operation,
it is clear, nevertheless, that the carload minima must
be so established as not to discriminate against the great bulk
of shipments of the more common sort. All along the line one
meets with such illustrations of the bearing of the minimum
carload upon rivalry in business. Large shippers are continually
striving for a high minimum. The small shippers
oppose it for the same reasons. In a similar way the interest
of the manufacturer distributing his goods direct, in competition
with middlemen, is vitally affected.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Car capacity, both as regards ability to load and carry
economically, is the principal factor in the determination of
minimum carload rates. It is largely a question of relative
cost of operation.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Reference has already been made to the
great economy incident to the use of large cars, whereby the
paying load becomes less in proportion to the deadweight. This,
of course, largely accounts for the steady increase in carload
capacity in recent years. But the question is even more complicated.
An adjustment must be made between two main groups
of freight: first, that which is sufficiently heavy to be readily
loaded to the minimum weight in ordinary cars; and, secondly,
light and bulky goods of which the common car will contain
but a small proportion in bulk of its truck capacity by weight.
Fortunately, we may evade the moot point, theoretically, as to
whether a carrier is entitled to the same revenue from a given
vehicle, whether it be loaded with heavy or light goods; that is
to say, whether the rate ought properly to decrease per pound
with increase in the density of the lading. This is a technical
matter as to cost. But it carries certain implications of considerable
importance commercially, as will shortly appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>The difficulty of conforming carload minima upon light and
bulky articles to those on heavier goods has appeared with each
attempt to standardize equipment. Widely divergent rules in
the three main classification territories still cause great confusion
in this regard. There is a constant temptation to construct
extra long or wide cars, particularly in the western states,
in order to assist the manufacturers of such light and bulky
products as furniture and agricultural machinery in their competition
with dealers in the East, shipping under Official Classification
requirements. In other words, the penalty carried
under the rules as to minimum carloads, for the use of cars
larger than the standard, has been much less in the West than
in the East and South. The situation has been further complicated
in some instances by the arbitrary action of state railway
commissions. The experience in this regard is illuminating,
as again showing the extreme delicacy of adjustment in such
matters under the stress of commercial competition. The
short-line distance between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers
lies entirely within the state of Missouri. It governs, as we
have already seen,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> the entire rate structure in this part of the
country. This commonwealth some years ago by law fixed a
carload minimum of 20,000 pounds for furniture, agricultural
implements and wagons.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> As it is not practicable to attain this
minimum load on an ordinary standard car, the Missouri shipper
was stimulated to demand larger equipment in order that he
might avail himself of the lower rate for carload lots. The
local railways, accordingly, built such cars, which, of course,
travelled far beyond the limits of this single commonwealth.
This forced other western roads, in order to protect their clients
in the same markets, to adopt a similar policy. The result is
that extra large equipment is relatively more common throughout
this territory; thereby conferring a distinct advantage over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>their eastern competitors upon western shippers of such light
and bulky freight. In pursuance of this same protective policy,
the western roads have also enforced distinctly favorable rules
as to carload lots applied to several small cars instead of one
large one.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> These troublesome details are given in the hope that
they may show how far the ramification of trade competition
extends. They re-enforce the conviction that any reform of
classification is a matter of extreme difficulty; and, if undertaken
at all, must be done under governmental compulsion and
by a single universal reform, rather than by any attempt at
piecemeal improvement.</p>

<p>Next to ability to load and carry, as a determinant factor in
fixing minimum carload weights, the consuming capacity of the
market must be considered. A reasonable minimum carload in
the East might well be unfair in the West or South. An old-established
factory in New England might satisfactorily use a
quantity of raw material which in a carload lot would overwhelm
a western or southern plant. Thus it comes about that minimum
weights on the same goods quite properly vary widely in
different territories; being higher in the East than in the West,
and least of all in the South. The problem, therefore, of
standardizing carload rates throughout the country, unfortunately
becomes exceedingly difficult. A compromise will fail
to satisfy anybody; and, moreover, such a change of minimum
carload weights at once necessitates a remodelling of the particular
distance tariff to which it applies. This point was well
illustrated in a recent case.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> A railway accepted for the same
carriage at different times two carload shipments of lime from
a given concern. On the one, a rate of thirty-four cents per
one hundred pounds was based upon a minimum carload weight
of 24,000 pounds. On the other twenty-nine cents was assessed
upon a minimum of 30,000 pounds. The carrier alleged that
these differences in rates per pound were entirely compatible in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>view of the difference in carload minima. It then appeared
that these minima, especially with a perishable commodity
like lime, varied considerably according to destination. Large
distributing centres were given low rates on high minima, while
small towns, consuming relatively less, were best served by a
lower carload minimum to which a higher rate per pound was
applied. In other words, the close interrelation between the
rate and the minimum was a matter of great commercial
importance.</p>

<p>The relation of carloads to consuming capacity of the
market is an element in the trade policy of protection to clients
extended by the railway. The difficulty of properly relating
rates upon raw and finished products has already been discussed.
Carload minima must also be considered in this connection.
Why should 50,000 pounds be prescribed as the carload limit
on corn to Texas points, when the limit on corn-meal is only
30,000 pounds? Evidently differences in loading capacity are
inadequate as an explanation. Nor can this be accounted for
on the ground of any difference in mere cost of carriage. The
explanation is purely commercial&mdash;springing from the competition
between northern mills and mills located in Texas,
both making use of raw material from the same fields. A heavy
carload minimum is entirely practicable on corn for the Texas
miller; but an equally heavy carload requirement on corn-meal
would shut out the northern miller entirely from many local
points. For the market at these small places is, of course,
relatively restricted.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> There can be no doubt that every
feature of classification, even down to the last minute details
of carload minima, stands in such intimate relation to commercial
competition, that to disturb it in one regard may entail
the most far-reaching consequences.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ever since 1888 the constantly increasing elaboration of the
three main classifications in force, with all the resulting inconsistencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and overlappings, has led to a persistent demand for
the introduction of a single uniform classification for the entire
country. Soon after the passage of the original Act to Regulate
Commerce in 1887, a resolution passed the House of Representatives
directing the prescription of such a classification.
Apparently the Interstate Commerce Commission was fully
alive to the difficulties of such an undertaking. The railways
were induced to move in the matter, but to no purpose.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> This
first abortive attempt reflected the mutual jealousies of competing
roads, as well as the difficulties of suiting a single classification
to the variety of local conditions existing throughout
the country. All that was done was the recommendation of
a "Board of Uniform Freight Classification," comprising two
members from each of the important territorial bodies and including
both the Mexican and Canadian carriers. Changes
were to be made by a two-thirds vote. Jurisdiction over the
tripartite division of territory, east, south and west, was to be
assigned to district chairmen. Final authority for the country
at large was to be vested solely in the whole board. The absolute
refusal of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River to accede
to this plan prevented its acceptance. Apparently too many
special or commodity rates were in force upon its line, in order
to hold its powerful clients in markets all over the country, to
make it practicable to adopt the scheme. Efforts toward uniformity
were renewed in 1890, confined this time, however, to an
attempt to merge the Official and Western Classifications. But
the same jealous regard of local interests in each territory,
especially with reference to the treatment of carload ratings,
once more proved an insuperable obstacle. The trunk lines
insisted upon such specially low charges on small shipments as
would enable manufacturers and jobbers in the East to hold
their markets in remote districts in competition with rivals
in the Middle West. The issue raised in the New York Board
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>of Trade case, previously discussed, led to the defeat of this
plan.</p>

<p>A notable revival of interest in uniform classification
under governmental authority has taken place since the
enactment of the Mann-Elkins amendments to the Interstate
Commerce Law in 1910. An independent bill in Congress
to authorize the enforcement of such a schedule failed.
The railways were stimulated, however, to make a further
attempt to solve the difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Protracted sessions during
1907-1908 by a conference of five representatives from
different parts of the country, known as the Uniform Classification
Committee, led to many concessions and compromises
in favor of harmony. The committee expressed
its belief that a uniform classification could be drawn up in
time; but it emphasized the important point that all
changes in classification must be accompanied by such advances
or reductions in the distance tariffs as to insure the
prevailing commercial adjustments.</p>

<p>The latest advertisement of the difficulties of uniform classification
took place in connection with the attempted introduction
in 1912 of various amendments and reforms proposed
by this Uniform Classification Committee.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Acting in conjunction
with the National Association of Railway Commissioners,
an earnest attempt seems to have been made to eliminate
differences between the three great schedules. Few articles
were actually shifted from one class to another, the effort being
concentrated upon the establishment of more uniform rules and
descriptions. It was alleged by shippers that more often than
otherwise, these changes had brought about an advance rather
than a reduction of charges. It is difficult to decide as to this.
But it is clear that progress in the direction of uniformity is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>taking place. For example, the minimum carload weight for
paper, once varying greatly in different parts of the country,
was fixed at an intermediate figure which fairly satisfied conflicting
interests. Many opportunities for personal discrimination
were also eradicated. Grading according to value, for
instance, has in the past been a prolific source of abuse. Candy
at less than fifteen cents a pound rated third class, but if of
higher value moving on first-class rates, offered an incentive
to false declaration on the part of unscrupulous shippers which
was very properly eliminated. Abolition of the distinction
between finished stationery and flat paper, put an end to possible
underclassification in the same way. Naturally the carriers
in abolishing such fine distinctions, grade upward rather than
downward. Much objection was also made at this time to
beneficial modification of the rules for mixed carload shipments.
Binder twine had for years been classified with ploughs and
harvesters rather than with ropes and cordage. Half a carload
of agricultural machinery, therefore, with half a carload of
twine, formerly moving under carload rates, was no longer, as
proposed, to be allowed the privilege of mixing. Similarly,
abolition of the right to bunch wood-working and iron-working
machinery naturally aroused protest. Such details are here
offered, not because of their intrinsic importance, but as illustrating
the opposition on behalf of shippers to any movement
toward uniformity, even in these minor details. What the
force of this opposition would become, were propositions advanced
for shifting thousands of articles bodily from one class
to another, may be readily imagined. The experience thus far
obtained, emphasizes the point that any considerable improvement
must be carried through, if at all, by direct pressure from
governmental authority, not upon the carriers alone <i>but upon
the shippers as well</i>.</p>

<p>The degree of complexity at the present day incident to
overlapping and conflicting jurisdiction of the several state and
railway classification committees and associations, may be best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
described by means of a few examples.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Traffic originating in
Southeastern Freight Association territory, except Florida,
destined to cities in trunk line territory is governed by the
Southern Classification all the way if moving on through rates;
if on local rates, the Official Classification applies north of the
Ohio river. From "Green Line territory"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> to Pacific coast
terminals, the Southern Classification governs to the Mississippi
or other gateways; the Western Classification beyond. But if
it originate in Louisiana or Mississippi, the Western Classification
governs all the way. From most places in Tennessee,
Western Classification rules govern all the way, "subject to
commodity rates or less-than-carload consignments, classified
not lower than fourth class." To Wisconsin from points
throughout the South, the Southern Classification governs all
the way. But to Minnesota, generally, Southern rules govern
to the Ohio river crossing, while Western rules apply to the
balance of the trip; unless the goods move through trunk line
territory by way of the Virginia gateways, in which case the
Official Classification is effective. These are only a few samples
chosen from a large collection. Is it any wonder that to the
uninitiated, rate making under such conditions appears to be
almost a superhuman task; and is it surprising that to the
unscrupulous, such complicated conditions give rise to more or
less successful attempts at evasion of published rates?</p>

<p>The present threefold territorial division of the country,
for the purposes of classification, naturally affords all sorts of
possibilities in the way of veiled discrimination, not merely as
between persons but as affecting the interests of different competing
markets. Not only is there liability to confusion, but
the way is paved for all sorts of favoritism. Wherever shipment
is made from one classification territory to another, it is
always possible to adjust the rates with a view to local advantage.
For instance, one of the principal causes of complaint in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>South is the advantage which Nashville, Tennessee, enjoys
through having all of its rates from eastern and northern centres
made upon the Official Classification. Inasmuch as the rates
under the Southern Classification are considerably higher, this
operates to place other competing cities in the South under a
distinct disability in competition with Nashville. It is possible,
therefore, for the Louisville &amp; Nashville by this means to build
up one community at the expense of another. The same
device gives Richmond, Norfolk and the other Virginian cities
a great advantage over their competitors.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Again, rates from
New York to Memphis and New Orleans are made upon the
Official Classification, by whatever route; while to intermediate
points, such as Vicksburg, Natchez, and Baton Rouge,
they go on the rates prescribed by the Southern Classification,
which are considerably higher. From New York to St. Paul
through Chicago, shipments are made on the low rate basis of
the Official Classification; while from Chicago to St. Paul
they go under the Western Classification. From Birmingham,
Alabama, to St. Paul, the rates as far as Chicago are based upon
the Southern schedule, and from thence on under the Western.
From San Francisco to St. Paul, the Western Classification
prevails, unless the freight is carried under the commodity
rates of the Transcontinental schedule. The peculiar situation
of Nashville on shipments from the Northeast has already been
stated. This immediately complicates the rates from so-called
Cook County Junctions&mdash;that is to say, from Chicago territory.
All consignments for the entire distance are governed
by the Southern Classification. This, in face of the low Official
Classification rates from trunk line territory, operates as a
discrimination against Chicago. Even more complicated still
are the combinations by which rates are made from local points
in the North into the Far Southwest. And still farther complexity
results from the existence, as already mentioned, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>several parts of the country, such as Iowa, Illinois, Georgia,
etc., of state classifications, prescribed by the railway commissions.
These, to be sure, are intended for application only
to local rates. But by this means, the jobbing interests of the
localities are protected, without at the same time giving consideration
to an equitable adjustment as between all the
remoter interests concerned.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> One of the primary advantages,
therefore, from the unification of the three systems now existing,
would be the possibility of readjusting not only definitely,
but also equitably, the conflicting interests of various shippers
and communities now tied up by these local arrangements.</p>

<p>A recent case<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> illustrates the bearing of classification rules
upon competition in trade as between rival cities. Chicago and
most of the Ohio river gateways enjoy a so-called "two-for-one-rule,"
permitting the application of carload rates on part carloads
in excess of full car ladings. The complaint alleged that
the denial of this privilege to Indianapolis, whereby less-than-carload
rates were charged on excess fractional carloads, unjustly
discriminated against this city in the transportation of
various light and bulky articles, such as vehicles and furniture,
in competition for trade throughout the Southwest. The
difficulty arose from a conflict between rules in the Western
Classification and the Southwestern Tariff Committee, the
latter being a subordinate body having jurisdiction over local
practices in Texas and the neighborhood. The rule in one case
provided that where a car of sufficient capacity to accommodate
light and bulky shipments could not be promptly furnished,
two smaller cars would be provided, subject to wholesale rates,
however the consignment was divided between the two cars.
The Commission declined to interfere in this case, anticipating
the necessity for a thoroughgoing revision of all such rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>which, it is obvious, almost invite manipulation of rates and
improper discrimination.</p>

<p>Even a cursory examination of the classification a few years
ago would bring to light all sorts of petty anomalies and inexplicable
conflicts both of description and rates. Most of these
doubtless had some warrant originally, but it seems, indeed, as
if many differences might be eliminated.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> For instance,
"excelsior spring beds K. D. (knocked down), sawdust, and
leather belting, are all in the second class of the Official Classification,
when shipped in less-than-carload lots. In the
Western, only the belting and beds are in the second class,
excelsior is third and sawdust fourth; while in the Southern,
beds are first class, belting second class, excelsior fifth class,
and sawdust sixth." The recent complaint of the Greater Des
Moines Committee<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> disclosed an odd state of affairs under which
old shoes were given a carload rating to Des Moines&mdash;an
advantage not extended to new and unused footwear. Why
should axes be given carload rating in trunk line territory
when the freight rate on hatchets is the same whether the shipments
are in 100 pound or 20,000 pound lots? Is it
logical that cotton piece goods from Atlanta to Boston should
be differently classified from the same commodity exchanged
between the same two cities in the opposite direction; or that
goods should enter Richmond, Virginia, on one classification
and go out on another? Such anomalies are sometimes difficult
to account for. Their existence, however, despite the efforts
of the carriers to eliminate them and to keep them eliminated,
emphasizes strongly the need for such continual revision as
shall more generally standardize practice. Few carriers alone
are able to withstand pressure from powerful shippers. It is
difficult, in fact, even for the classification committees to oppose
them. The strong hand of the government should enforce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>harmonious action to the fullest degree compatible with the
growth of trade and conflicting commercial interests. It
would help the railways even more than the shippers.</p>

<p>And yet, bearing in mind all the disadvantages and evils
of the present threefold system, the obstacles incident to the
substitution of a single uniform classification for the United
States grow more impressive as one examines them in detail.
Our vast territory and the extreme diversity of agricultural and
industrial conditions render the problem far more difficult than
in the compact and more homogeneous communities abroad.
The primary advantage of the present system is that each of
the three existing classifications more or less clearly reflects
local trade conditions in its own territory. From the point
of view of transportation, the same commodity may well be
able to yield widely different proportions of the total revenue
levied upon the traffic of that section. For example, cotton
piece goods may be rated first class in Western territory, fourth
class in Southern, second class less fifteen per cent. in Official
territory, and one-third of first class in the transcontinental
tariffs. The reason for this diversity of treatment is that such
cotton piece goods both in the South and the East are a staple
product of the district. The rates, therefore, in each case are
intended to foster the manufacture of cotton by according a
relatively low freight rate upon its output. In the West, on
the other hand, where no cotton is raised and no cotton mills
exist, these goods become much more valuable, as classified,
relative to other commodities. Oranges or lemons in southern
California are favored by almost commodity rates in order to
foster the industry in that locality. But these citrus fruits
reaching New England as a luxury, may consequently there be
made to contribute a much larger proportion of the railways'
revenue. The East, as a rule, classifies manufactured products
relatively low, inasmuch as it is the home territory for industry
of this sort. But these products, when they pass beyond the
Mississippi, rise almost automatically to a higher class as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
increase in value to the community in which they are consumed.
How different are the commercial conditions under which wool
is rated east and west! In one territory it is distributed to
manufacturers in small lots at way stations; in the other it
moves long distances in solid carload lots.</p>

<p>One further illustration may make our point clear. At first
sight it is anomalous that in the East the rates on cattle and
shoes between New York and Boston are not widely different,
namely nineteen cents and twenty-five cents, respectively, per
one hundred pounds; while as between Montana and Chicago,
the rate on shoes west bound is almost four times as great as
the rate on cattle over the same haul eastward. In other words,
rates on shoes in the East are at bed-rock, whereas in the West
it is the cattle rates which are held at the lowest possible point.
Ton-mile rates on shoes, in other words, increase progressively
toward the west, while ton-mile rates on cattle rise, contrariwise,
in the direction of the stronghold of manufactures. The difference
between the two, however, is in the fact that the upper
level of what the traffic will bear is very much greater in the
case of one than of the other. Cattle, possibly, may never
support more than seventy-five cents per hundredweight;
while shoes can be moved under rates four times as high.</p>

<p>Obviously any mere compromise between divergent classifications,
each based upon the protection of a local constituency
against competition from outside its own territory, can hardly
prove satisfactory. Cotton piece goods, already instanced in
this regard, if grouped as first class in the West, second class
less fifteen per cent. in the East, and fourth class in the South,
would hardly be adequately treated in a uniform classification
for the entire country by averaging these different figures.
For neither the West nor the South would be satisfied&mdash;the
rating being too high to fully protect the southern mills against
competitors in New England; nor, on the other hand, would the
classification be sufficiently high in the West to yield the roads
proportionately the revenue which goods of that character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
ought properly to contribute. The East, alone, lying intermediate
between the other two, would not be greatly disturbed.
The necessary outcome, it is predicted, of the adoption of any
such average or uniform classification would be the quotation
of exceptional commodity rates wherever the uniform classification
was at variance with local interests. The increase in
commodity ratings after 1887&mdash;now happily reversed&mdash;may
perhaps be in part accounted for in this way. Any such stimulation
of exceptional ratings would be a primary objection to
any uniform classification for the United States as a whole.
As one witness before the Interstate Commerce Commission
testified, "If ever there is a uniform classification, it will take
a warehouse to hold the commodity tariffs." Were such the
case, far greater complexity and possible discrimination might
exist than at the present time.</p>

<p>A second equally important disadvantage of the prescription
of a uniform classification arises from the fact, already
noted, that classifications and distance tariffs are interlocking
and interdependent. Any change of the one involves a change
of the other. Therefore, a unification of the three existing classifications
would render it necessary to overhaul from top to
bottom the distance tariffs under which it was to be applied all
over the country. For example, the rate from New York to
Atlanta, first class, being $1.14, while the rate from New York
to Chicago, about the same distance, first class, was 75 cents; to
choose a first-class rating which should apply on both these lines
would involve, not only a re-classification of the commodities,
but also that the new rates applying upon first-class goods
should be somewhere between $1.14 and 75 cents. Inasmuch
as it had taken many years to reach the present adjustment,
it seems hardly possible that a new arrangement could be made
which would yield the railways a satisfactory return upon their
traffic. The difficulty herein suggested was clearly instanced
in the case of a comparison made between the Southern Classification
and the Uniform Classification proposed in 1890. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
difficulty, and always a prominent one, was that the Uniform
Classification was largely for carload lots, while the practice
was entirely different in the old Southern Classification. Moreover,
most of the Southern rates were given for goods "released";
that is to say, at the owner's risk. Cotton piece goods, non-released,
in less-than-carload lots from New York to Atlanta,
were charged sixty cents a hundredweight under the old
Southern Classification. As reclassified in the suggested
Uniform Classification, the rate was ninety-eight cents; and
was given only for "released," that is to say, at owner's risk.
The difference for the same commodity from Louisville to
Atlanta was as fifty-six cents in the old Southern, to ninety-two
cents under the Uniform. Canned goods, not otherwise
specified, "non-released," in less-than-carload lots from Louisville
to Atlanta, were charged sixty-eight cents under the old
Southern Classification. The new Uniform Classification, in
order to yield the same revenue, made it necessary to charge a
rate of eighty-one cents. Differences of this kind were manifest
in every one of the thousands of commodities. In other words,
the adoption of a uniform classification meant to abolish by a
stroke of the pen all the old rates which formerly existed. An
entirely new schedule of rates would have had to be worked
out; with the most uncertain results upon revenue and upon
the rival commercial interests concerned. The magnitude of
such a task can be scarcely appreciated. Years would be
required to reach a condition of relative stability once more.</p>

<p>The close interdependence of classification and distance
tariffs, as well as, incidentally, the differing spread of rates
between various groups of goods under the three existing classification
systems, are so fundamental in their bearing on reform
that yet another illustration may not be out of place. It is
given in the following table. This shows the rates from St.
Louis&mdash;standing at the meeting point of the main classification
territories&mdash;for approximately equal distances out in three
different directions.</p>

<p>One line penetrates Southern territory 323 miles to Nashville;
another goes eastward 317 miles to Louisville under Official
ratings; and the third extends westward 320 miles to St. Joseph,
according to the schedules of the Western Classification. To
these three there is also added a set of rates north bound under
the Illinois Classification which applies between St. Louis and
Chicago, 284 miles. This last schedule, of course, is prescribed
by the state railway commission. The first point to notice is
the widely different number of groups in the four schedules.
One is divided into eight classes; another into six; while the last
two are each spread over ten subdivisions. Secondly, bearing
in mind that the three upper schedules govern approximately
the same mileage, it will be noted that the Official rate, first
class, is only about two-thirds of that in the other two classes.
If one then compares the sixth group in each case, an even
greater divergence appears&mdash;the Official rate being only
about one-half of that in the other two cases. Or, taking the
lowest rates of all in the three upper schemes&mdash;always, be it
noted, for equal mileages&mdash;it now appears that the Official
and the Western descend to about the same figure, while the
Southern is arrested at a point more than twice as high. The
primary significance of this showing is, of course, that a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
uniform classification in which all of these three systems should
be merged, means not merely a reassignment of all possible
commodities in a given number of classes; but also a complete
recasting of the distance tariffs as well. In other words, as
aforesaid, freight rates being compounded of the two factors,
distance charge and classification, all the delicate adjustments
based upon commercial competition throughout the country,
would be thrown into utter confusion; unless every modification
of the grouping of classes were accompanied by a corresponding
change in the rates per mile. A task sufficient
indeed to appall the best of traffic experts!</p>

<p>To complete the demonstration of the complexity of present
arrangements, and yet of the danger incident to rudely disturbing
them, one should apply the classified rates in the
preceding paragraph for these equal hauls to particular commodities.
Take household goods in carloads, for example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Examination of the classification volumes thus assigns these the
following rates in the three directions for equal distances out of
St. Louis. Going east the charge would be 34.5 cents, going
west 19.5 cents, and going south 23 cents per 100 pounds,
respectively. The hodgepodge is made more manifest by the
right hand column in this table, in which the percentage of
first-class rates levied upon household goods in carloads under
the four classifications is shown. Under the Official system,
with the lowest first-class rates, as above noted, the rate on
household goods is higher than under any of the other three.
The result is that the relation between the rate on household
goods and first-class goods is eighty-three per cent.; whereas
in the other two cases it is substantially less than half this
percentage. This single illustration, it is hoped, may drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
home the conclusion that there is an immense mass of fortuitous
and utterly unreasonable allocation under the classification
systems as they are at present established.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But whether that
may be used as an argument in favor of substituting a single
uniform classification is open to serious doubt. Rather does
it serve to emphasize the fact that rigid revision of the present
scheme under Federal control, perhaps, is more necessary than
an experiment in uprooting the entire system.</p>

<p>A few general conclusions may be drawn from this rather
over-elaborate description of present conditions as to classification
in the United States. It has been necessary, however, to
reiterate details in order to make clear the extremely unsatisfactory
situation at the present time. In fact, in this domain of
classification, standardization of practice so characteristic of
American rate making and operation in general, has noticeably
lagged behind. Whether it will be possible, in view of the wide
extent of the country and the diversity of its climatic and commercial
conditions, ever to devise a single uniform classification
is open to serious doubt. Even the Interstate Commerce Commission,
once a leader in the demand for uniformity, now concedes
this fact in particular instances.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Thus:&mdash;"wool east of
the Mississippi is taken up at numerous points and is carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>under comparatively light loading. What would be a fair
classification there, would not be just in the Far West, where
the movement is almost entirely in carloads and where the actual
loading is from two to three times that in Official Classification
territory. We are of the opinion that wool should be classified
under the Western Classification as second class, l. c. l., and
fourth class, c. l.," etc. The experience of England is, of course,
commonly cited as a precedent.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> In that little country the
ever-increasing complexity of classification was precisely parallel
to our own. From simple schedules for a few hundred articles,
the number of items steadily increased until there were over
4,000. At this point the government intervened; and after
tedious and protracted sessions under the auspices of the Board
of Trade in 1888 the whole schedule was brought down to 1,400
separate items. All the complicated and confusing rules were
harmonized and many anomalies were cut out. Certain it is
that matters should be firmly taken in hand in this country in
the same manner. The separate state classifications and hundreds
of conflicting rules and jurisdictions should be eradicated.
Even if a single uniform classification be proved impracticable,
as seems to me likely, it might still be possible to greatly simplify
the present intolerable mix-up. There should be a representative
of the Interstate Commerce Commission on each of
the classification committees, ready at all times to exert pressure
for simplification and uniformity.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The three main classification
committees, supposing that they shall continue to exist,
should interlock by exchange of representatives. The greater
the reform flowing from the initiative of the carriers themselves,
the better. Thus, in time, matters may become sufficiently
standardized as between the three main committees so that,
under legal compulsion or otherwise, the final problem of uniformity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>may be tackled by recasting the whole body of tariffs
and classifications together. But such a task at this writing
appears almost superhuman. Conditions may, of course, so
shape themselves ultimately that it may be brought about.
But, in the meantime, steady and persistent pressure should
be exercised in the direction of this final goal. Reform of
classification practice is certainly the greatest need of the time
in the transportation field.</p>

THE TRUNK LINE RATE SYSTEM: A DISTANCE TARIFF</h2>

<p>The trunk line freight rate system effectively demonstrates
certain principles in railway economics which are of great
importance. The danger of arbitrary administrative interference
without a full understanding of the intricacies of rate
making, and at the same time the essential soundness of
American railway practice in seeking independently to solve
these complex problems by equitable means, are amply illustrated.
The fallacy of certain objections to governmental control,
on the other hand, is revealed with corresponding clearness.
Three principles in particular deserve mention in this connection.
These are: (1) that the element of distance should be a
prime factor in the final adjustment of rates as between competing
localities;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> (2) that co&ouml;peration and agreement between
competing carriers are essential to any comprehensively fair
system; and (3) that permanency and stability of rates are of
equal importance with elasticity. That all three of these results
have been voluntarily worked out in practice by the trunk lines
is a tribute at once to the ability and fairness of their traffic
officials. Standards are thus established toward which the
carriers in the West and South should strive, as soon as their
local traffic conditions will permit, in an endeavor to promote
good relations with the shipping and consuming public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>That distance tariffs, modified in part to suit commercial
conditions, are not only theoretically sound, but entirely
practicable, this study aims to prove. The bogey of German
rate schedules vanishes into thin air when it appears that the
greatest railway companies in the United States have for
years adopted the same principles in working out their tariffs.
The long and short haul rule is here enforced, not alone as between
various points on the <i>same</i> line, but also as between
points equally distant from a common destination on <i>different</i>
roads. Thirty years ago the trunk lines conceded the principle,
for the recognition of which the shippers of the West and
South are now so vociferously clamoring before Congress and
the Federal courts.</p>

<p>This desirable end could never have been attained if the
several competing companies had not been able to act in co&ouml;peration.
The erroneous popular opinion that railway competition
must be preserved in the public interest, had it been
legally enforced in this territory a generation ago, would have
prevented absolutely any comprehensive solution of the problem.
Until Congress abandons this theory, and treats railways as
essentially monopolistic, thereafter to be protected and maintained
as <i>beneficent</i> monopolies through adequate governmental
supervision, the lesson of trunk line experience will not have
been learned. And, finally, the interesting fact that for almost
thirty years it has not been necessary to change either the
main system or, in many instances, the actual rates charged
thereunder, is an offset to the contention that success in railway
operation is to be judged by the instability of rates, seeking to
follow constantly the ups and downs of commercial conditions.
Certain modifications, especially in export and import traffic,
or wherever water rates have to be made or met, are, of course,
inevitable. But it is absurd to reason from this that railway
tariffs in the main need to be continually jostled about at the
behest of the shipping public. Of course, if one railway changes
its rates, all the rest must follow. That is the principal reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
why many of our rate schedules have been as uncertain as the
weather. But there is no reason why, if all parties in competition
keep good faith and observe their tariffs, a schedule of
class rates for domestic shipments should not remain practically
constant.</p>

<p>Take the rates on raw cotton from Mississippi river points
like Memphis to New England cities, for example. Was any
staple product ever subject to greater fluctuations in price
than raw cotton, varying as it has in the last few years, from
five to fifteen cents a pound? Yet through it all, good years
and bad, whether for the planter or the manufacturer, the freight
rate has stood unchanged at fifty-five cents per hundredweight.
In the same way, within the limits hereafter to be described,
the trunk line rate system has endured for a generation.
Founded upon sound and, consequently, defensible principles,
it has promoted good feeling between railway and shipper.
And, if the changes of classification since 1900 had not been
made, one may reasonably doubt whether the demand for
Federal legislation would have been any more insistent throughout
the eastern central states than it now is in New England.</p>

<p>The causes leading to the adoption of a systematic rate
scheme by the trunk lines acting jointly<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> can be understood
only in the light of the conditions existing about 1875. The
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad had entered Chicago in 1874,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>after which time the most furious rate wars between the four
trunk lines had been in progress. The main dependence
of all these lines was still upon the grain traffic, and all of this
was moving in one direction toward the seaboard. As late
as 1882, seventy-three per cent. of the trunk line tonnage
east bound consisted of such commodities.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Moreover,&mdash;and
this is a point of especial importance,&mdash;the bulk of this grain
originated in the territory east of the Mississippi and south
of Chicago. Over four-fifths of the eastbound traffic came
from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and
Pennsylvania. The great northwest and trans-Mississippi
territory was not yet opened up. Wisconsin and Iowa contributed
only about ten per cent. of the eastbound tonnage, while
over two-thirds of the westbound business did not pass beyond
Illinois.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Nor was the traffic concentrated as yet in the larger
cities. Mr. Fink makes it clear that most of the business was
gathered up by the trunk lines and their connections from
small towns along the way. The modern problem of the great
city in competition with the small towns was as yet unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>The trunk lines had few feeders. Only the main stems to
Chicago had been built. Consequently these central states
were served by a host of little cross lines, built as local enterprises,
many of them radiating from Chicago, Cincinnati,
Toledo, or Cleveland at right angles with the trunk lines, and,
for the main part, engaged in an endeavor to open up their
territories to water communication with the East by way of
the lakes and the Erie Canal. Rail rates, nominally at least,
were still high, the rate first-class Chicago to New York, for
example, being about double its present figure; and the conditions
of railway operation were such that water competition
was a matter for grave concern. Every change in the lake
situation was at once reflected in the rail rates, violent dislocations
at the opening and closing of navigation in the spring
and fall being of especial importance.</p>

<p>Among these confusing elements in the problem of trunk
line rate adjustment five distinct phases were prominent.
In the first place the four trunk lines were a unit in opposition
to the diversion of traffic to the Great Lakes and the
Erie Canal. However much they might bicker with one
another afterward,&mdash;apportionment of the rail business
being a distinct feature of the problem,&mdash;their interests at
the outset were identical respecting the necessity of holding
the business on land. Water competition by way of the
lakes or the Ohio river was a danger common to them all.
The intensity of this pressure may be understood from the
statement that the trunk lines were not even consulted in
making the Chicago-New York rate on which the western
lines pro-rated. They had no voice in it, merely accepting
the figure offered them by their connections into Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
The second feature of the problem, namely, the division of the
all-rail traffic among the competing carriers, is immaterial to
the main question before us. Thirdly, it was essential to
the trunk lines to restrict and control the activities of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>subsidiary cross lines and feeders, most of which, as has been
said, were independent. Many of these, aside from having a
direct interest in their longest haul to a terminus on the lakes
or the Ohio river, had been built by local capital, and were
administered in the interests of the lake cities or Cincinnati
and Louisville. There was no unity whatever in their policies,
and the most ridiculous wastes of transportation resulted.
Grain was literally meandering toward the East instead of
moving by a direct route.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Joint through rates would be
made by the most extraordinary chain of connecting links leading
to the seaboard by very circuitous ways.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>A fourth evil, akin to this, consisted of the difficulty of
maintaining through rates, not as among the trunk lines who
might be made parties to a pool, but by reason of cut-throat
competition between their western connections.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The agents
of these western lines would indiscriminately cut rates to or
from points on their lines, and then expect their trunk line
connections to accept a proportionate shrinkage of the joint
through rate for their part of the haul. The weaker companies
would, of course, be susceptible to such temptations in order
to secure the business. No stable apportionment of this
western traffic among the eastern lines would be possible until
they could agree upon a fair rate for the trunk line haul, and
rigidly adhere to it. And, finally, water competition, causing
constant fluctuations in the lake and Ohio river rates, while
directly potent only at waterway points, was continually putting
the through rates from these points out of line with the local
rates from non-competitive inland centres. Or, perhaps,
the Ohio river and lake rates would be out of joint with one
another. The Chicago basis, if applied to Paducah, would
make a rate on tobacco that would send it <i>via</i> New Orleans.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>Products would go down the Mississippi after the lakes had
been closed by ice. A considerable amount of corn was certainly
moved to New York by that route.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Some device for
coordination of the through and local rates&mdash;or, as one might
put it, for the distribution of the localized shock of water rate
changes&mdash;was imperatively necessary.</p>

<p>An ingenious rate clerk named MacGraham, in the offices
of the Pennsylvania Railroad, proposed a comprehensive
scheme for meeting these difficulties which was first used for
westbound rates on December, 15, 1871. The Chicago-New
York rate was to constitute a basis, upon which all other rates
were to be made in percentages, according to their relative
distance from New York.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Thus, assuming Chicago to be 900
odd miles from New York, the rate from a point 600 miles inland
would be about sixty-six and two-thirds per cent. of the Chicago
rate, whatever that might be. Whenever the lake rate at
Chicago changed, every other rate throughout trunk line
territory would vary in due proportion. Relativity of charges
would thus be preserved. Moreover, the shortest route,
"worked or workable," was to be used in calculating the rates,
the basic distance being about 920 miles by the Lake Shore
from Chicago to Dunkirk, Ohio, and thence by the Erie to New
York. This would give compelling effect to distance as a
factor, and would tend to penalize the roundabout carriage
of goods. More than this, however, it would render the inland
territory directly tributary to New York. From a point, for
example, fifty or one hundred miles south of Chicago, Toledo,
or Cleveland, the local rate into those towns plus the through
rate east to New York would always exceed the rate by a
direct route east. For the hypothenuse of a triangle is clearly
always shorter than the sum of the other sides. All shipping
points equidistant from New York would enjoy equal rates,
those rates at any time being determined by the state of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>competition. This was a manifest advantage to the small
inland centres, while the rate on the lake front was not affected.
The trunk lines lost something, perhaps, through lower rates at
intermediate points; but the gain through diversion of traffic
from the lake to the rail lines more than compensated. For
conditions were such in the summer of 1875 that the lake boats
were prepared to carry grain for almost nothing. The railroads
were helpless in such cases.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The only real sufferers were the
short, independent cross lines and the lake and river cities.
Of these, the former were reduced to a status of mere feeders or
branches of the trunk lines. They were compelled to accede
to the plan, however, by threatened refusal of the trunk lines
to turn over business to them westbound, unless they reciprocated
with their grain shipments eastbound.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Many of these
lines became bankrupt later, and were absorbed by the larger
companies.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> And, as for the cities unfavorably affected, the
scheme based upon distance was so obviously fair that their
protests were of no avail.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The great contest between the trunk lines over the granting
of differentials to Philadelphia and Baltimore, as against New
York and Boston, played a not unimportant part in the diplomacy
leading to the acceptance of the MacGraham system.
The New York Central, the Lake Shore, and the Boston &amp;
Albany roads, of course eagerly accepted it, because it promised
aid in meeting the lake competition to which they were peculiarly
exposed. The Pennsylvania and the Erie, lying considerably
further from Lake Erie, would also be benefited,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>operating as they did in a territory naturally tributary to them,
but exposed to drainage to the lakes by lateral lines. But the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio, ever since its entry into Chicago in 1874,
had been a thorn in the flesh of the others. The territory
along its line was so far from the lakes that it had little to fear
from water competition at intermediate points between Chicago
and the seaboard. Would it accept a plan primarily intended
to meet a danger which, while injuring its powerful rivals, was
of less consequence to itself? Fortunately for the scheme, it
was based upon the solid principle that distance was of preponderating
influence in the adjustment of rates. The entire
contention of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Pennsylvania for a
differential rate to Baltimore and Philadelphia below New
York rested upon this same principle. The distance from
Chicago to the southern ports was less. Consequently, they
insisted, they were entitled to offer a lower rate. The MacGraham
scale and the port differentials were thus logically
connected. They stood or fell together. The MacGraham
plan materially aided the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in making good its
demands.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> It was acceptable, therefore, by reason of this
collateral advantage.</p>

<p>Another factor in the situation appealed to the Pennsylvania
and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. Their lines to tide water were
about seventy-five and one hundred miles shorter, respectively,
than the shortest line to New York.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> In the division of the
joint through rate between a chain of connecting railway lines
this was of great advantage. It always aids the shorter line
if pro-rating is based upon mileage. A feeder one hundred
miles long pro-rating with a trunk line one thousand miles in
length would be entitled to only one-eleventh of the total rate.
Were the trunk line only eight hundred miles long, the neutral
road might claim one-ninth. This seemingly slight difference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>might mean several hundred thousand dollars more earnings
to the neutral road or feeder, if it turned over its business to
the short line.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Any emphasis upon distance as a general principle
strengthened the Baltimore &amp; Ohio in securing patronage
from other roads by this means. The other trunk lines, through
acceptance of the MacGraham scale, conceded the distance
principle, and with it, coincidently, the pro-rating practice.</p>

<p>After three years' experience, the MacGraham scale was
readjusted to conform more closely to the cost of service principle.
The plan, as thus revised, is the one still in force.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> It
recognizes that railway charges should be proportioned to the
length of haul, so far as actual costs of haulage are concerned;
but it first eliminates those constant elements in cost which do
not vary with distance. The original MacGraham scale made
no such distinctions. The expenses at terminals, such as loading
and unloading, are, of course, entirely independent of the
distance covered by the shipment. These, being determined
roughly by experimentation, are first deducted from an assumed
Chicago rate. From the remainder the rate per mile by the
shortest route to New York (920 miles) is then calculated by
simple division. This rate per mile is then applied to the
distance to any intermediate point, and the terminal charge is
again added. Thus a rate is found which is reduced to a percentage
of the original Chicago base rate.</p>

<p>The revised system provides in theory for an absolutely
constant rate per ton mile. It is a rigid mileage tariff in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>respect. The original MacGraham scale had been so in theory,
but not in practice. As amended in conformity with a sound
economic principle, it had, moreover, one important practical
advantage over the original scale. It yielded more revenue
at all the intermediate points.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Local rates would be higher
as thus calculated than they were originally. It would be
unjust to ascribe undue importance to this motive on the part
of the roads in the adoption of the new system. That the plan
yielded additional revenue, while obviously more just in theory,
was naturally no objection to its acceptance.</p>

<p>The fruits of all this process of adjustment are depicted
upon the accompanying diagram. Viewing it in a large way,
and reserving details for later consideration, we may compare
it to a topographical contour map. The several rate zones
are thus analogous to a series of levels or steps rising from east
to west. Our cross section of these along a line from Pittsburg
to Burlington, Iowa, makes this relation plain. Another cross
section at right angles to the first from Louisville, Kentucky,
to Lansing, Michigan, and beyond, shows how these levels are
arranged in a plane from north to south. These steps form a
sort of irregular amphitheatre opening toward the east, with its
main axis lying in a direction slightly south of west toward
St. Louis. Or, more correctly, these rate zones, pursuing our
analogy to a topographical contour map, indicate a broad valley
opening toward the east. Along the bottom of this freight-rate
valley lie the great direct trunk lines converging from Chicago
and St. Louis. Throughout the State of Illinois the valley
opens up onto a plateau, somewhat grooved in the middle at
Peoria, where the direct lines from the west cross a neutral
field tributary neither to Chicago nor St. Louis exclusively.</p>

This general description harmonizes with the apt figure used
by that master mind in railway economics, Albert Fink. Speaking
of this situation, he says, "The trunk lines are nothing but
great arteries of commerce, like rivers, only with this difference:
the rivers never run across each other, the territory from which
they draw their supplies is distinct and well defined." Since
his time, by reason of co&ouml;perative action for a generation, the
confusing maze of railway lines has now been reduced to a
single comprehensive system. Cross-currents of trade hither
and thither have been united or articulated in such a way as,
speaking in terms of freight charges, to cause the great internal
commerce of the country to flow downhill toward the seaboard
in an orderly and reasonable way. The inequalities incident
to commercial competition have been modified, or, to revert
to our original figure, eroded; so that one may literally speak
of the products of the country as flowing, like rivers, in more
or less natural channels over the railway lines from the great
interior basin towards the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>The mathematical precision of the method of computation
heretofore described, while theoretically applicable to a series of
parallel roads in a flat country, free from either water competition,
the competition of cross railway lines, or the competition
of towns and cities of unequal size and importance, obviously
requires modification to suit the actual traffic conditions in
this densely populated trunk line territory. The process of
adjustment has been gradual and necessarily tentative. Every
influence brought to bear has been subversive of systematic arrangement,
tending, that is to say, to amend the scheme out of
all semblance to mathematical order. After reading volumes
of the Proceedings of the Joint Rate Committee, filled with
petitions of railways, towns, and individuals for exception to
the general rules, one is surprised to find that, after all, the
scheme is so well ordered as it is. It has been held true only
by rigid adherence to the rule that by the shortest "workable
and worked route" no intermediate place shall be charged more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
than is charged to any point beyond. In other words, the long
and short haul principle is consistently observed. Space does
not permit a discussion of all of the factors which have tended to
modify the original simple scheme. Three alone may be considered
as illustrative of the rest. These are: (1) the effect of
railway competition at the important junction points; (2) the
influence of the independent cross lines of railway; and (3)
commercial competition between producing or distributing
centres.</p>

<p>The effect of railway competition at junction points is
revealed at once, upon inspection of the map, by the general
law that the boundary line of zones lies immediately west
of the large cities. Notice the location of Cleveland; Warren,
Pennsylvania; Newark, Ohio; Dayton, Fort Wayne, Detroit,
Port Huron, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Louisville, Lansing,
Logansport, Terre Haute, Peoria, and Decatur. Columbus,
Toledo, and Evansville, Indiana, are about the only exceptions.
In nearly every case the theoretical zone boundary has been
shifted in such a way that the rate rises just west of the important
competitive point. The reason is obvious. Rates being
held down at these points, and no greater rate being possible at
any other point further east, conditions must be equalized
<i>upwards</i>, immediately the depressing influence of competition
is removed. Each zone level is of necessity an average of a
theoretic constantly rising scale from east to west. Places
immediately west of an important junction point are raised
somewhat above their theoretical grade as a compensation for
those places on the westerly side of each zone whose rate is held
down below their theoretical level by the exigency of competition
at the next large town. Or, to be specific, Indianapolis
may hold down the rate to ninety-three per cent. of the Chicago
rate farther west than otherwise would be the case. In fact,
by reason of its paramount importance as a railway centre,
it has held down the rate so far west that for purposes of equalization
the rate west of it immediately jumps to one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
per cent. For, as will be observed, on inspection of the map,
the 96-97 per cent. zone is interrupted at this point; the 92-95
per cent. zone being extended unduly far west and the one
hundred per cent. zone being extended inordinately far east,
until the two meet just west of Indianapolis. Detailed
study of the schedules and maps will reveal many similar
instances.</p>

<p>The converse of the proposition that important junction
points lie near the western zone boundaries is found in the fact
that, where competition is absent, the zones sweep much farther
east than mathematically would be prescribed. In other
words, wherever competition is less keen, the percentage rates
remain high. Were competition entirely uniform in its geographical
distribution, the several zones would be parallel,
sweeping evenly clear across the map. Illustration of this
circumstance will be found in the extension of the 87 per
cent. zone far to the east, along the Ohio river, in fact nearly
to Parkersburg, West Virginia; or, again, in the 110 per cent.
territory which extends nearly to Louisville. This latter rate
has been recently amended, as will be shown later; but for
many years continued, as here represented, abnormally far to
the east. In both these instances the railway facilities along
the river are monopolized by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio as a trunk
line. The only competition is due to the Cincinnati, Hamilton
&amp; Dayton and Norfolk &amp; Western, both of which work their
traffic from New York north. The population and traffic
density being at the same time low, a relatively high level of
rates has resulted. Sometimes, also, it may happen that in
these outlying regions the shortest line "workable and worked"
to the seaboard may not be due east, but may proceed north
until a junction with a trunk line can be effected.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of independent transverse lines of railway
has been of great importance in shifting the zone boundaries
from their theoretical location to conform to practical requirements.
Study of the map permits a second important generalization.
Not only does the boundary of the zones usually lie
just west of large cities, the course of the boundary at the same
time frequently follows the location of important independent
transverse railways. The zone boundary, in other words, lies
just west of the cross railway line. For example, the western
boundary of the 100 per cent. Chicago zone, after leaving a
point on the Illinois Central, is defined from north to south by
the course of the Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railroad, and
below Terre Haute by the line of the Terre Haute &amp; Evansville.
Similarly, practical exigencies determined the odd shape of the
110 per cent. zone, formed like a great distorted boot leg.
The western boundary of this 110 per cent. zone from Peoria
south closely follows the Peoria, Decatur &amp; Evansville road
nearly to the Ohio river. Similarly conditioned by railway
lines are the boundaries north and south of Indianapolis, and
especially north and south of Fort Wayne, Indiana. In other
cases where the transverse lines do not cross nearly at right
angles with the trunk line, the zone boundary will follow one
railway for some distance, and then skip across to another
railway whose general direction is more nearly perpendicular
to the trunk lines. Thus, from Toledo to Lima, Ohio, the
western boundary of the 76-80 per cent. zone follows the
Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton, cutting the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
and Pennsylvania trunk lines at right angles; and then it
jumps across to the east until it strikes the sweep of the Toledo
&amp; Ohio Central, which carries it down almost to Columbus.
Similarly, the western boundary of the 66&frac12; per cent. zone
follows the line of the Pittsburg &amp; Western north from
Warren, in order that that line may participate in New York
business by working its line north <i>via</i> Painesville on the Lake
Shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>Why is it apparently necessary that these zone boundaries
should follow along just west of the cross railway lines? The
reason may be made clear by a concrete instance. Originally
and until about 1891, Louisville, Kentucky, instead of having
the 100 per cent. Chicago rate, as at present, enjoyed, on the
base of its distance from New York, about 96 or 97 per cent.
of the Chicago rate. In other words, the 96-97 per cent. zone
shown on our map as interrupted at Indianapolis, partly for
reasons already mentioned, originally swept across the map all
the way from Grand Rapids to the Ohio river. This territory
from Chicago south is served by the Monon Railway (Chicago,
Indianapolis &amp; Louisville), whose line, not fully indicated on
the map, thus lay partly in 100 per cent., partly in 96 per
cent., and partly in 97 per cent. territory. An important
part of the traffic of the Monon, as well as of the other
independent north and south lines, consists of business coming
in from the east at the north and worked south, or coming
in from the east at the south and worked north. Or, in
other words, this line subsisted in part upon indirectly routed
tonnage from New York, let us say, destined for Louisville,
but reaching it by way of Chicago junction points. Freight thus
hauled around two sides of a triangle, instead of by a direct line,
as described in Chapter VIII,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> constitutes one of the important
sources of waste of transportation energy. The Monon by such
tactics is able to participate in, and to profit by, a much larger
volume of through business. That is to say, its proportion of
the entire haul is much greater than it would be if the business
moved by the shortest line. Moreover, when indirectly routed,
the Monon, often securing for its trunk line connections tonnage
for the east which would naturally go to other competitive
trunk lines, is able to exact a higher pro-rating than even its
extended lateral haul would justify on a strictly distance basis.
Such circumstances always greatly enhance the profitableness
of lateral hauls to minor connecting roads. It is obvious that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>much of this transverse haulage would be impossible wherever
the lateral railway lines traverse different zones of rates. It
might haul traffic from its 100 per cent. end to connect at its
96 per cent. end with a trunk line for the east, but not in the
opposite direction. The Monon, always in a position to
disturb the rate situation, through connection with all the
competing trunk lines, insisted upon equality of rates all along
its lines. To do this, the 100 per cent. zone had to be extended
east to Indianapolis. Thereafter the Monon could profitably
"work its line in both directions." This illustration will serve
to show why ordinarily the zone boundaries conform as closely
as possible to the course of the lateral roads. The confusion
which would be engendered, were the Peoria, Decatur &amp; Evansville
to be partly in the 110 per cent. and partly in higher percentage
territory, while still insisting upon its right to work
its line both ways, can readily be imagined. To avoid such
difficulties, the present modification of strictly distance percentages
had to be adopted.</p>

<p>The third dominant influence, above mentioned, in modifying
the mathematical precision of percentages based alone
upon the distance from New York, has been the commercial
competition of traders and cities one with another. The aim
of all rate adjustment should be, and in fact, so far as possible
in American railway practice, is to equalize conditions, so that
the widest possible market shall result. Producers or traders
in each city demand access on even terms to all territory naturally
tributary to them by reason of their geographical location.
Each particular railroad sees to it that its own patrons and
cities are "held" in all parts of these markets, as against the
efforts of competing railways to promote the welfare of their
own constituencies. Consequently, the Proceedings of the
Joint Rate Committee are filled with discussions as to the advisability
of amending general rules here and there to suit
local conditions. Minor changes are continually being effected.
Grand Rapids, Michigan, once in 100 per cent. territory, asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
for a 90 per cent. rate, and in 1891 secured a reduction to 96
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Louisville, once in 97 per cent. territory, is now a
100 per cent. point. Shifts in both directions have frequently
occurred, as the following table of percentages shows:<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>A number of changes were made in 1887 in order to conform
to the long and short haul clause. Flint, Michigan, for example,
was reduced from 95 to 92 per cent.; Ashtabula, Ohio, from 71
to 67; while Springfield, Ohio, was raised from 82 to 83 per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Detroit has been most active in prosecuting its claims
for a reduced percentage.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> But the Interstate Commerce
Commission in 1888 upheld the present status. A recent minor
change is indicative of the forces which must be dealt with.
Evansville, Indiana, on the Ohio river, according to our map,
is a 110 per cent. point. Vincennes, Indiana, lies just north of
it in the 108 per cent. triangular zone. Since this plate was
made, Evansville has been reduced to 105 and Vincennes to
103 per cent., respectively. This is substantially, I am told,
on a mileage basis. The reason for the amendment is that
certain important industries are located at these points.
Either to favor them specially or to remove a pre-existing
disability in competition with other towns, this change was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>insisted upon by the railways interested in their prosperity.
By tentative processes of adjustment like this the present
general relations have been established.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> They have
been kept constant only by the steady resistance of the
majority of carriers to action which is in the interest of a
few. Judged by results, it would appear that the broad view
has, in the main, prevailed.</p>

<p>The actual situation resulting from the above-named
causes, it should be observed, is not quite as simple as our map
makes it appear. Most of the zones are in fact subdivided into
minor gradations. Thus the closely dotted zone designated
"86-90 incl." is constituted of an 87 per cent. area up as far as
the railway from Dayton to Indianapolis; while the rest of it is
broken up into little 88, 89, and 90 per cent. areas, respectively.
The same thing occurs elsewhere. Our map generalizes the
results, in an effort to bring out the zone relationships as fully as
is technically possible in a single diagram. Certain of the
zones, however, such as the 60, 66&frac12;, 100, and 110 per cent.
territories, are bounded exactly as here represented.</p>

<p>As for direction, the original scale was intended only for
eastbound traffic. Westbound rates were lower and more
regular. But the system worked so well that it was soon
extended to cover the westbound business. Owing to difficulties
of routing, in order to transport by the shortest line
into Chicago, these westbound percentages were often quite
different from those in the opposite direction.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Detroit, for
instance, for some time prior to 1886, enjoyed a 70 per cent.
rate west bound, while its percentage in the opposite direction
was 78.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> But, after the passage of the Act to Regulate Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>merce
in 1887, efforts were made to harmonize the differences.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
At the present time the rates east and west are in most cases the
same.</p>

<p>At this point it is essential to understand the limitations
within which this percentage system is confined. It does
not necessarily determine the exact rate to be applied in practice
from every little station in trunk line territory. For, in the
first place, it concerns only the so-called common points;
that is to say, points where competition of two or more carriers
is effective. Purely local stations are charged an "arbitrary"
into the nearest common point.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> But, inasmuch as throughout
this much be-railroaded country most shippers are less than
twenty miles from the next line,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and since, moreover, the
arbitrary can never raise the local rate above the rate to the
next common point beyond,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> the scale is practically effective
everywhere. A more important consideration is the fact that
this scale, even for common points, does not positively fix the
rate. It merely provides a minimum below which rates shall
not be reduced, except by authority of the roads acting jointly.
It is a minimum, not a maximum, schedule in every sense.
Its provisions are never promulgated in the form of tariffs as
such. They are rarely known to shippers, but serve only as a
guide to traffic officials. The Interstate Commerce Commission,
in sanctioning the system, has expressly recognized this
fact.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Moreover, these percentage rates applied at first to
"classified" tonnage. They were soon, however, extended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>include the great bulk of commodity or special rates which are
independently made. And I am informed by the chairman
of the Trunk Line Association that the MacGraham table was
applied to special rates&mdash;such as sugar, coffee and molasses&mdash;as
early as 1871.</p>

<p>Other exceptions to the applicability of this percentage
system deserve mention, although they are of relative unimportance.
Principal among these is the confusion engendered
in Illinois territory through the entry of the western lines into
Chicago. Throughout their constituencies, by reason of the
sparse population, freedom from competition, inequality of
east, and westbound tonnage, and low-grade freight, western
railroad rates per ton mile are very much higher than on the
trunk lines. Moreover, they are naturally desirous of as long
a haul as possible, namely into Chicago. To turn over their
local Illinois traffic to the trunk line feeders exposes them
financially to the same losses as those above mentioned in the
case of lateral independent lines further east. But these
western lines, being stronger, have insisted upon recognition
of their claims to a proportion of the through rate which would
at least "pay for their axle grease."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The result is that
throughout Illinois, especially in the north and toward the
Mississippi, the distance principle is considerably distorted, as
our map clearly shows. The percentage system practically
excludes freight "from beyond," the rates on that being
determined by other rules.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>East of the Central Traffic Association territory shown on
our map the same percentage system is extended to points in
New York and Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Suppose, for example, the
rate were desired from Columbus, Ohio, to Albany, New York,
or any other point between Buffalo and New York City. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>rate from Columbus to New York City would first be determined
as a percentage of the Chicago-New York rate, under the system
already described. Then from Columbus to Albany the rate
would be prescribed as a new percentage of this percentage.
The initial western points, however, are not determined individually,
but are comprehended in large groups. Thus the
rate from all points in the 72-78 per cent. territory, shown on
our map, to Albany, New York, is 96 per cent. of what the rate
would be from those points to New York City. Syracuse has
76 and Utica 87 per cent., respectively, of the rate from any
point in this 72-78 per cent. territory. From points beyond
Chicago, taking, that is to say, more than 100 per cent. of the
New York-Chicago rate, the percentages of the rate to New
York City applying to Albany, Syracuse, and Utica are correspondingly
modified to 96, 84, and 91, respectively. Other
complications, such as the addition of arbitraries to Boston and
New England points or the subtraction of differentials to Baltimore
and Philadelphia, follow. But, in the main, conforming
always to the long and short haul principle,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> rates to all local
stations are prescribed within narrow limits by means of a
small number of these fixed points. The system is the same,
although details may vary. Everything interlocks and is
harmoniously related on the distance basis.</p>

<p>Rates from one point to another within the Central Traffic
Association territory shown on our map now alone remain for
consideration. These cannot, of course, be adjusted on a
percentage basis, inasmuch as such traffic may not be east or
west bound at all, but may consist of shipments in any direction.
There is no logical reason why they should interlock with east
or westbound through rates when the traffic is, perhaps,
moving locally north and south. Nevertheless, the long and
short haul principle is observed with the same fidelity. A rigid
distance tariff for short hauls, the limits of which are prescribed
by the rates for long hauls under the MacGraham schedule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
prevails.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> For distances up to 75 miles this conforms closely
to the rates originally prescribed by the Ohio legislature. For
greater distances it is much lower than the Ohio tariff.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Thus
the Ohio rate for 350 miles is 87.5 cents, while the C. F. A.
(Central Freight Association) scale is only 42 cents. The
Ohio scale for 200 miles is 50 cents, the C. F. A. rate for the
same distance is only 33 cents. Thus it appears that this C.
F. A. tariff, applicable to interstate business and beyond control
of any state legislature, has, in reality, been voluntarily adopted
by the interested railroads. The tariff is only a minimum
scale, below which the roads agree not to reduce rates, and
above which the actual rates often rise.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Nevertheless, the
fact remains that these rates, according to distance, are so
much lower than the Illinois Railroad Commission's tariff
that Chicago and other distributing centres throughout the
State of Illinois claim that it works great hardship to them.
The situation in Illinois is geographically peculiar. Its great
commercial centre is in the extreme northeastern corner, while,
at the same time, the greatest extension of the state is north
and south. These circumstances, coupled with an interstate
(C. F. A.) tariff lower than the Illinois official tariff under which
Chicago merchants must ship out their goods, enable Detroit,
Indianapolis, and Cincinnati to undersell Chicago in its own
state. Chicago can be equalized there only by special or secret
rates.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Other local centres, like Quincy, Illinois, joined with
Chicago in this complaint to the Illinois Railroad Commission
that their rates were too high.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Think of it! Shippers complaining
that a government rate was too high, and requesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>that the railway tariff (C. F. A. schedule) be adopted in its
place! Is that not evidence that reasonable treatment of its
shippers by railway companies is appreciated by the public?
Without undue extension further details of this interesting controversy
cannot be given. It will suffice to state that in December,
1905, the Illinois Railroad Commission ordered a reduction
of its official schedule by 20 per cent., in an attempt to reduce
its rates to conform more nearly to the C. F. A. railway tariff.</p>

<p>The evils incident upon two conflicting governmental
authorities, State and Federal, each attempting to regulate
rates independently, are clearly indicated in the preceding
paragraph. The Interstate Commerce Commission has been
brought flatly up against them in one of its recent Texas cases.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Local and interstate rates must inevitably be adjusted with
reference to one another, so complex are the conditions of commercial
competition. While the plain people remained unsatisfied
that any real Federal regulative power existed, it was
inevitable that the number of arbitrary state tariffs, like those
of Illinois and, more recently, of Missouri, should tend to increase.
But now since the amplified Federal powers under the
laws of 1906 and 1910, any clash between the two must result
in limitations placed upon state activity.</p>

<p>
"First.&mdash;That from all points being less distant from New York than

section, according to the percentages of distance shown by the table
adopted at Chicago, April 30, 1876, to which result so computed the 6
cents per 100 pounds of fixed charges first above deducted shall be again
added, and the percentage of the Chicago rate of 25 cents, produced by
such additions, shall thereafter constitute the percentage of the Chicago
rate, which shall be subsequently charged from the points named in first

When Chicago paid 25 cents, the rate to this point would be 20 cents.
Under the new scheme the intermediate rate would be 80 per cent. of 19
cents, or 15.2 cents, plus 6 cents terminal charge, making a total of 21.2
cents. This is 84.8 per cent. of the Chicago rate instead of 80 per cent. as

<p>The rate system in the southern states contrasts sharply
with that of trunk line territory.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Its most unsatisfactory feature
is its complete violation of the distance principle. Public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>dissatisfaction was long voiced by a large number of complaints
before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the early days,&mdash;a
cessation of these complaints since 1900, however, was the
result of the nullification of the law by judicial interpretation,
rather than an indication of any acquiescence of the public
in the scheme. Next to settlement of the problem of transcontinental
rates, a reasonable adjustment of the southern
situation is one of the important tasks confronting the
Federal authorities.</p>

<p>Certain natural features of southern territory are connected
with its peculiar rate system. The first of these is its scattered
and relatively thin settlement. Density of population varies
between one-third and one-fourth of that in the northern states.
This greatly limits the volume of local business. In the second
place, the largely agricultural character of the country, yielding
a traffic predominantly of low grade, has had a great effect.
Much attention being devoted to cotton, there is little local
interchange of freight. The business, moreover, is largely
seasonal in character. In the early days, at least, practically
all of the profits of the carriers had to be made between September
and January. This concentration of interest in the movement
of the cotton crop is now rapidly being supplanted by a
much more general movement of traffic; but the rate system
in force is an outgrowth of the conditions prevalent in the early
days.</p>

<p>The entire dependence of this territory for manufactured
goods upon the northeastern states, and for foodstuffs upon the
West, has had a profound effect, we have seen, upon its railway
development.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The predominant direction of traffic is rendered
quite peculiar by contrast with trunk line territory. In the
North, the principal railroads lie parallel, east and west; in the
South, they are radially distributed outward from Atlanta like
the spokes of a wheel. Imagine a triangle with its apex at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>city,&mdash;the focus of all transportation interests in the South,&mdash;and
with its other two angles lying at New York and Chicago
respectively. The hollow centre of this triangle, as appears
by the accompanying map, is occupied by the Allegheny
mountain chain. The movement of traffic historically along
the western side of this triangle has been overwhelmingly
southward; at one time the disproportion southbound from
western territory being as thirteen to one.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Along the eastern
side of this triangle,&mdash;that is to say parallel with the Atlantic
seaboard,&mdash;the preponderance of tonnage, by bulk and
probably by value as well, has been toward the north. In this
direction cotton in the early days, and latterly lumber, have
moved from southern fields and forests to northeastern markets.
In Virginia-Carolina territory, today, about three-fifths of the
loaded mileage is north bound. The uneven distribution of
traffic is still further complicated by the excess of tonnage eastbound
in trunk line territory along the northern side of our
triangle, above mentioned. This general description explains
many of the abnormalities in freight rates throughout this
territory. Bulky staples moving one way, while manufactured
goods, high in value but more concentrated in weight, go the
other, greatly complicate the problem of economical operation.</p>

<p>Another omnipresent complication in the southern states is
the widespread existence of water competition. The situation
in the South in this regard is not unlike that of England. Its
entire territory is threaded with a series of more or less navigable
watercourses which penetrate from the seaboard or the
Mississippi river, far into the interior. Here again is a physical
peculiarity of the southern territory, which historically explains,
even if it does not fully justify, as we shall see, certain peculiarities
of its freight rate system.</p>

SHOWING
PRINCIPAL RAILROAD SYSTEMS
IN THE
SOUTHERN STATES</p>

<p>[Facing page <a href="#Page_382">382</a>]</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first general characteristic of the southern system is the
relatively high level of freight rates. Bearing in mind that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>distance from New York to Chicago is practically the same as
from New York to Atlanta, the freight rate, first-class, on the
trunk lines was, in 1900, 75 cents per hundredweight as against
$1.14 to Atlanta. Sixth-class rates then stood to one another
as 25 cents and 45 cents respectively, the relatively high ones
being in the South. Reference, for example, to the table on
page <a href="#Page_349">349</a>, will bring out this contrast at the present time in
another way. According to this the rates in the South are not
higher than in the West for the same distance. The disproportionately
high charges in the South, however, occur mainly
in the field of local rates. And it is the local, rather than the
through, charges, which cause the present dissatisfaction. The
principal complaint concerning through rates is that they are
made up principally as the sum of locals based upon Ohio or
Mississippi gateways.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Whenever such sums of locals have
given place to unbroken through rates, a large measure of
satisfaction to shippers has resulted. And then, finally, it
should be observed that certain peculiarities of the classification
system somewhat increase the relatively high grade of
charges throughout this territory,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> tending to support the
allegation that rates are unreasonably high.</p>

<p>The so-called basing point system is the second fundamental
peculiarity of southern rate adjustment. It has already been
discussed in connection with local discrimination.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> This basing
point system, although not absolutely confined to the South,
has been more highly developed here than elsewhere. In
principle it is simply this: certain cities are established as basing
points,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and rates to all other places in that neighborhood are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>made by adding to the through rate into the basing point, the
local from that city to the final destination. Since local rates
in the South, based upon slender local traffic, are always exceedingly
high, this appears to confer a very great advantage in
the matter of charges on the cities thus favored. The way in
which this system is opposed to the long and short haul principle
in law has also been discussed in another connection.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> On the
face of things it certainly appears unjust that goods should be
transported directly through the place to which they are ultimately
to go; and after being hauled to the basing point with a
heavy charge for that haul, should thereafter be brought back
again with the addition of a second high local rate for the
service. And yet that very commonly occurs.</p>

<p>A number of economic defences for the basing point system
have been urged by the carriers at different times. The most
substantial one is that the basing points, historically, were
originally important trade centres and are still intimately
related to the business customs of the South.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> These trade
centres, it is alleged, were not made by the railroads: they were
in existence before the railroads were constructed. They are
an outgrowth of the agricultural system of the region. In
the West a farmer may take a sample of his grain to the nearest
town and sell the whole crop by that sample. No such transaction
is possible with cotton and tobacco. Each shipment
must be sampled, weighed and classified on its own merits.
Such grading cannot take place at local stations. Convenient
commercial centres are, therefore, a necessity, serving for the
proper concentration of products. These trade centres, moreover,
arising in connection with the sale of staple products of
the soil, became natural distributing or jobbing points. The
planters naturally buy in the places to which they resort to sell
their crops, often employing the same merchant.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> As such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>natural trading centres, these southern towns are forced to
compete with the older established distributing cities up north.
At this point a second defence of the basing point system arises.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
It is urged that a decentralization of jobbing trade in a sparsely
settled or newly developed territory can be effected only by
means of encouragement through peculiarly favorable rates to
offset the strength of the remoter great cities. The plausibility
of this defence, however, is considerably weakened by the fact
that under the peculiar southern classification system, carload
ratings are largely absent.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Therefore, as it appears, the local
jobber in the South competes under a disability as compared
with New York and Cincinnati which is no less at the basing
point than in the small town. Still a third, and probably a
valid, defense of this violation of the distance principle by the
use of basing points, is the paucity of local business. It is
alleged that in the North the competitive points are so near
together, and the volume of competitive business is so large,
that it pays to reduce the charges at immediate points. In
the South, on the other hand, competitive points are so far
apart and, relatively speaking, the local tonnage is so small,
that the adoption of such a policy would be ruinous.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent defence of the basing point system
brought forward at all times, and greatly emphasized in proceedings
before the Interstate Commerce Commission, is the
widespread existence of water competition. Carriers allege
that in order to secure any portion of the traffic at many points,
low rates must be offered, quite irrespective of the charges to
intermediate inland stations. They affirm that to lower all
rates to this "compelled" competitive level, would deplete
their revenues and lead to bankruptcy. This has been the
main excuse for the persistent violation of the long and short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>haul clause by carriers in the southern states down to the present
time. The evidence goes to show, however, that on the lesser
streams, at least, the steamers are so small, their service so
irregular, and the incidental risk of damage, cost of insurance
and other expenses of transhipment are so great, that the railroads
practically control the business.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Furthermore, in many
places it appears that the water lines were either owned by the
railroads or appeared in league with them; or else that a division
of the business had been effected by which the little river
steamers were accorded a certain proportion of the low grade
freight.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Such facts have been established before the Interstate
Commerce Commission, for example, in the so-called Dawson
case concerning the Chattahoochee river; on the Ocmulgee
at Macon in the Griffin and Hawkinsville cases; at Montgomery
in the Troy case; and on the St. Johns river at Palatka, Florida,
in the Hampton case. A competent witness has declared in fact
that there is "no more real water competition at many of these
places than in the Rocky Mountains."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Probably the potentiality
of competition is somewhat greater today with improvement
of the larger navigable waterways. It seems to be real
at Chattanooga since the construction of the Mussel Shoals
canal; but that it has in late years been effective at Nashville
seems open to question. The practical disappearance of the
Mississippi river traffic also points to the decline in importance
of the great rivers as rate regulators, except in respect of the
carriage of ore, lumber, and coal. Whether the National
Waterways movement will ever succeed in its revival is, it
seems to me, open to serious question.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>Analyzing these several grounds of defence, a distinction
should be made at the start between three varieties of basing
point. This is not clearly brought out in the numerous decisions
upon rates in southern territory. In the first group are
the old natural trading centres, usually once blessed with
effective competition by water, even if at the present this is of
limited character. Savannah and Montgomery, Alabama, are
of this type. Then, secondly, there are the great railroad
centres like Atlanta and Birmingham. These are modern
creations without water competition of any sort, although the
rivalry of railroads with one another is exceedingly keen.
Until recently, moreover, this competition has been over such
widely divergent routes that agreement has been difficult and
consolidation impossible.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> And, then, in the third place, there
are the basing points which seem to be absolutely artificial.
A number of these are to be found in the southeastern part of
Georgia, such as Cordele, Americus, Albany, etc. In these
cases the only criterion which seems to have been adopted is
that the place shall have attained sufficient importance to
enable it to compel some carrier to give it special privileges in
the matter of rates. As was tersely stated in a leading case&mdash;Cordele
at that time not having been made a basing point:<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Cordele is not treated by defendant roads as a competitive point,
because it is not a sufficiently large distributing point, and it is not
such a distributing point because it is not treated as a competitive
point. Hence it appears that the roads seek to excuse their wrong-doing
by offering the results of the wrong in justification. Judged
by its results, this system of rate making is at variance with all the
equality provisions of the act to regulate commerce."</p></div>

<p>The subsequent experience in this last case is significant.
One of the carriers at Cordele having afterwards discovered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>advantage to itself in making this town a basing point, all the
other railroads were compelled to acquiesce. Such a thing has
happened frequently throughout the South; with the result that
many places have been given strongly preferential rates for no
other reason than the arbitrary decision of some one of the
carriers. Even the railroads themselves recognize this fact.
They often deplore the necessity for reducing rates because
of action by competitors at some particular point; but no
option remains. It is with reference to this third class of
purely artificial basing points that the most dissatisfaction
among shippers arises.</p>

<p>The awkward and unreasonable situation is well exemplified
in a very recent case,&mdash;important, also, because it was the first
to be decided by the Interstate Commerce Commission under its
new and enlarged powers. The location of Ashburn in southeastern
Georgia, a county seat with a population of about
2,200, is shown with references to surrounding places by the
map on opposite page.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> It lies in the centre of an irregular
quadrilateral, the corners of which are occupied by Cordele,
Albany, Tifton and Fitzgerald. It has no commercial standing
at present, but, being as large at least as Tifton, aspires to
become a distributing centre in its immediate neighborhood.
Yet from every direction its rates are made by a combination
upon these surrounding towns. The disparity is illustrated
by the charges from New York, which are $1.42 per hundredweight,
first class, as compared with $1.17 to all the neighboring
places. Examination of the history of these favored towns
shows, however, that they have acquired their favored status
as basing points, neither because they were originally important
trading centres, nor because they enjoyed water competition.
Two of them, actually, are as remote from streams as is Ashburn.
The fact is that the competition of western and eastern dealers
with one another, backed in each case by local railroads having
routes or affiliations either northeast or northwest, has brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>about their establishment as basing points. Neither is Ashburn
today more of a local point than either Tifton or Cordele
when they were first granted lower rates. As one examines
further, it appears that this keenness of trade competition
between East and West,&mdash;that is to say, from Baltimore and
New York as against Cincinnati and Chicago, etc.,&mdash;which
has brought Atlanta into prominence and made it finally the
key to the entire southern rate arch,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> has in the same manner
led to the special favors granted to one town as against another.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 636px;">
<img src="images/illus407.jpg" width="636" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>In this case the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered an
equalization between all five points. It is to be hoped that
this special case may be a point of departure for a general
reform in the immediate future of the entire iniquitous scheme
of local favoritism which has too long been allowed to exist.</p>

<p>The entire artificiality and even at times iniquity of the
basing point system is admitted in the following brief for the
railways in the Alabama Midland case before the Supreme
Court of the United States. "There may be," it is conceded,
"a few mere 'railroad junctions' in the South, which, owing
to the ignorance or corruption of certain railroad officials, have
been arbitrarily 'called' competitive points and which 'receive'
certain arbitrary 'concessions' in rates to which they are not
justly entitled. There may be also a few strictly local stations
in the South, which are not even 'railroad junctions,' where
arbitrary and unfair 'concessions' in rates have been made by
certain corrupt railroad officials, to enhance the value of property
owned at such stations by said officials, or by their relatives
or friends ... [but they are] the offspring of ignorance or
corruption and should not be recognized by the courts." This
artificiality is also proven by the difference of practice which
exists on the various southern roads.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The worst offender and
most defiant opponent of the government from the inception
of Federal regulation, has been the Louisville &amp; Nashville
Railroad. The Southern Railway introduced the long and
short haul principle in the main on its through line to Atlanta
long ago. On the Atlantic Coast Line few violations of the
distance principle exist, and the condition is improving. No
basing points whatever exist in South Carolina; and the state
railroad commissions in general are working for betterment.
Neither the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio nor the Norfolk &amp; Western,
operating alike in sparsely settled regions, find it necessary to
violate the distance principle. One of the curses of the scheme,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>however, is that irregularity of one carrier may compel its neighbors
to adopt a policy which they recognize as unjust. Only
by compulsion applied to all alike can a just solution be had.</p>

<p>A determined effort was made in 1880 by the carriers
themselves to apply the trunk line rate system, based upon
the distance principle, to the southern states.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> A thoroughgoing
scientific readjustment was proposed. The situation is
significantly described in the following extract from this
report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your committee entered upon the performance of their duty
entertaining the sentiment that experience and observation have
rendered generally potent among those in charge of the revenue interest
of transportation lines, namely, the necessity for more intelligent and
defensible methods of making competitive freight rates than the
following of figures, descending to us from tariffs named on arbitrary
bases or conditions now obsolete, or by the assumption of differences
between centres of trade now changed or junction points now no longer
such, or other methods for which there are no reasons capable of
satisfactory explanation."</p></div>

<p>Representatives of most of the important lines subscribed to
this plan; but it fell through at the last because of the opposition
of others, selfishly viewing their own particular interests
rather than the general welfare of all. It is clear that while
minor improvements may be introduced, no widespread reform
can be effected without the interposition of Federal authority.
It is to be hoped that this exercise of authority under the
larger powers now conferred by Congress since 1906 may not
long be withheld.</p>

<p>A third and essentially different problem respecting southern
rates concerns the discrimination against western cities in favor
of those along the Atlantic seaboard. This has been for years
before the Interstate Commerce Commission in the Cincinnati
and Chicago Freight Bureau cases.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The amount of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>discrimination appears in the fact that at the time of the
original complaint, the rate from Cincinnati to Atlanta was
ninety-four per cent. of the rate from New York to the same
point; although the distance from Cincinnati was scarcely
more than half of that from New York. It appears as if
this difference were largely the result of keen water competition
by coastwise steamers,&mdash;a competition which
affects rates for a considerable distance inland all along the
coast as far as New Orleans. Where such water competition
is absent, there seems to be a general arrangement as between
East and West which is standardized by distance. Atlanta
gives the keynote; and all rates from outside southern territory
change with its fluctuations. The disability against western
cities may be expressed, therefore, in another way, by the
fact that New York, although so much farther north than
Baltimore,&mdash;supposed theoretically to be kept on a par with
Louisville as to rates,&mdash;reaches Atlanta on lower charges
than are made to Cincinnati.</p>

<p>Fortunately an attempt at improvement of the southern
rate system will be greatly aided by the wonderful industrial
revival which has been under way during the last decade. The
growth of population, and especially the development of manufactures,
may render it possible for the carriers to endure the
hardship which any traffic readjustment always entails. The
growth of manufactures, measuring in a way the degree to
which the South is learning to supply its own needs, appears
in the fact that in 1907 it converted one-fifth of its cotton
production into cloth, and reduced from its own ores one-half
of its consumption of pig iron in its own local factories. Furniture
shipments to the South were once large. At the present
time High Point, North Carolina, is second only to Grand Rapids
in this line of manufacture. Every new mill and mercantile
establishment which springs up, is bound to help to a degree
in the transition from a mediaeval scheme of rate making to a
more defensible system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>The Texas "common point" system affords a valuable
illustration of the influence of competitive forces in trade in
bringing about an equalization of transportation charges over
a wide area.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> It also shows the danger of localization of interest
through the exercise of piecemeal control by state commissions
rather than the enforcement of broad-gauge regulation by the
Federal government. The settlement of the great area of
Texas naturally first took place by extension inland from the
Gulf coast. All supplies came by sea from the north. Freight
schedules were scaled from the seaboard according to distance,
more or less, in competition with stage and wagon. Gradually,
however, with the growth of St. Louis as a rival centre of distribution,
railroads serving that city penetrated directly from
the northeast. The St. Louis jobbers were at once brought
into keen rivalry with merchants in North Atlantic states,
served by coastwise steamship lines. This competition beginning
at the points of contact of the two different sets of railroads,
gradually extended all over the state. St. Louis lines,
acting for local jobbers whose goods came from New York,
might not charge more at any point in the aggregate than the
total rate from the same initial city which applied by way of the
Gulf steamers. Nor could the railroads in from the Gulf ask
more for both steamer and rail carriage than the entire double
charge from New York around by way of St. Louis. The
natural stronghold of the Gulf lines was in the centre and the
south; northern Texas was more naturally tributary to St.
Louis; but gradually a compromise was effected whereby
equality of rates was accorded either from New York or St.
Louis to all stations throughout the state. Thus arose the
so-called Texas Common Point Territory, to all parts of which
Kansas City, Chicago, and finally all other distant cities were
admitted on even terms.</p>

<p>Another feature of the Texas rate adjustment is suggestive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>
<p>A vast territory, uniform in products and needs, might either
be served by a few great distributing centres or by a larger
number of smaller ones, each forming the natural focus of
trade within a given district. Believing the latter arrangement
to be better suited to local conditions, the Texas Railway
Commission has arbitrarily prescribed such intrastate tariffs
as to foster the development of a number of such jobbing points
or mercantile centres. Local rates, more or less proportioned
according to distance, are graded up to a maximum, all based
principally upon the needs of the principal city, Houston, as
served by its seaport, Galveston. The significant feature of
these Texas local rates, however, is the fact that beyond a fixed
maximum,&mdash;say 245 miles on classified tonnage, or 160 miles on
cotton,&mdash;no further increase of rate occurs with extension of
the haul. That is to say, beyond a certain radius fixed by the
maximum rate, distributing centres are placed upon an entire
parity with one another. Fort Worth, for example, within a
distance of about two hundred miles, naturally has an advantage
over all other competing centres, more distantly located; but
outside of this zone, naturally tributary to it as a provincial
trade centre, all others such as Dallas, Waco, or San Antonio enjoy
equal opportunity. In only one respect is the distance principle
violated: namely, in the preferential rates from the north
to Houston and Galveston as compared with the higher charges
to intermediate Texas points. These primary centres are
encouraged by standing in a class by themselves.</p>

<p>This theoretically admirable Texas system is, however,
unstable in several regards. It is artificial in that it is primarily
adjusted to the needs of the state, without reference to the
rights of other places lying beyond its borders.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The railroads
naturally desire to contract the common point territory; the
forces of trade rivalry seek to enlarge it. The growth of middle
western cities and manufactures, supplying Texas from their
own domestic plants rather than merely redistributing goods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>manufactured in the East, also tends to modify the scheme.
Whether the common point system, therefore, can long withstand
the force of these disintegrating influences remains to be
seen. The conditions are not compact and homogeneous as
they are in New England, which enjoys a similar flat rate
system. And it may well be that ambitious cities along the
northwestern border of the state, like Fort Worth, may finally
succeed in forcing concessions in rates from the Middle West
on the ground of their relative nearness as compared with
competitors further south. On the other hand, distributing
centres farthest away from the main sources of supply, like
San Antonio, would naturally resist any infraction of the rule
of parity. And then, again, it is becoming apparent that the
decentralization of distribution through a number of second-rate
jobbing towns rather than from one pre&euml;minent centre,
is hindering the growth of a metropolis, able to compete on even
terms in high grade products with the older centres of the East.
Few dealers in Texas cities are able to purchase dry goods or
boots and shoes in carload lots, that is to say, on the lowest
terms as concerns freight rates; and the combination of shipments
of different goods to make up a miscellaneous carload
rate, thus overcoming this disadvantage, is open to serious
objection.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> All told, therefore, the experience of Texas is well
worth attentive consideration, as a study in the intimate
relationship between trade and transportation. The sharpness
of contrast between such a common point scheme and the
basing point system of the other southern states, brings the
relative advantages and defects of each into strong relief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transcontinental freight rates have been brought into
prominence of late in direct connection with the wonderful
growth of population and trade on the Pacific slope.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>territorial possessions in the Pacific and the development of
Oriental trade, together with the general interest in the Panama
Canal since 1900, have all conspired to direct attention to this
complicated problem. The first point to notice is the relatively
high level of rates, averaging very much more per mile than
anywhere else in the United States. The following table of
rates in 1905 is significant:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>These distance tariffs, however, as already explained in our
chapter on Classification, need to be supplemented by additional
details in order to bring into relief the relative amount
of the charge. So far as these figures go, it will be observed
that for a distance about two and one-half times as great as
from Chicago to New York or the Gulf of Mexico, the rates to
San Francisco are very much higher in proportion.</p>

<p>The unrest among shippers in far western territory is not
due to the relatively high tariffs in force. It arises primarily
from the nullification of the distance principle in rates. And,
in the second place, it hinges upon the relation between carload
ratings and the development of local jobbing business.
The primary factor in the making of rates to the coast has
always been the existence of water competition, either by way
of Cape Horn or the Isthmus of Panama.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The facilities for
cheap transportation over these routes have compelled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>all-rail lines to make low through rates which would enable
them to secure a portion of the business. Inasmuch, also, as
most of the competition of the steamships over these very long
routes involves shipments in large quantity, competition with
the railroads has mainly been felt in making rates by the carload.
The result has been the existence for many years of a
special transcontinental tariff, more or less uniformly adopted
by all the roads, which consists in the main of commodity rates
for carload shipments, the scale of these rates being sufficiently
low to meet steamship competition as above described.</p>

<p>This simple situation has been complicated by the fact that
all of the transcontinental lines, except the Southern Pacific
with its eastern terminus at New Orleans, have had a particular
interest in building up both manufacturing and jobbing business
at their eastern terminals at Chicago or Missouri river points.
For such a policy enabled them to secure the entire charge for
the transportation of commodities to the Pacific coast, without
the necessity of a pro-rating division, as when goods are hauled
from the Atlantic seaboard cities. The situation then resolved
itself practically into a competition of markets. Chicago,
St. Louis, and St. Paul were pitted against New York, Philadelphia,
and other Atlantic ports in rivalry for the trade of the
Pacific coast. In order to benefit the cities in which they had
a peculiar interest, the all-rail lines, therefore, gradually introduced
what is known as the system of "postage-stamp rates."<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
That is to say, they gradually extended to one city after another
east of the Mississippi river, the same rates to the Pacific coast
as were enjoyed by the seaboard cities. As a consequence, for
some years every city east of the Mississippi has been able to
ship goods to San Francisco at the same rate which is paid from
Boston and New York, which may be more than a thousand
miles farther away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>This system is justified in theory, even for rates from Chicago
and St. Louis, as due to water competition; and it has been
said that commodities are sometimes shipped from as far
inland as this to the Atlantic seaboard, and thence to San
Francisco by water. The latest phase of the controversy
reveals the weakness of this argument. The inland cities, such
as Chicago and St. Louis, having been accorded the same rate
to San Francisco as New York and Philadelphia, demand lower
rates than the Atlantic cities in proportion to their relative
nearness to San Francisco. In other words, they demand that
the rates, instead of being made upon the "postage-stamp basis"&mdash;absolutely
the same from all cities, however remote&mdash;shall
be graded. This would give Chicago, St. Louis, and St. Paul
an advantage in laying down manufactures or in distributing
products secondarily, in competition with the older centres at
the East. To this policy the jobbing interests of the Pacific
coast strenuously object. From their point of view, any grading
of rates will enable the western cities to compete with them
directly in local distributive business. They do not object to
the low rates from the eastern seaboard, nor would it avail to
do so because the natural conditions of water competition are
beyond control. Moreover, the low rates from Atlantic points
are all, as above said, on carload lots, and such low carload rates
operate distinctly to the advantage of the Pacific coast jobber,
enabling him to obtain goods in wholesale lots, and then to
break bulk in order to distribute them up and down the coast.</p>

<p>The intimate relationship between the carload question
and the grading of rates to interior centres, is plain from the
foregoing paragraph. Viewed by itself alone, the carload question
is not dissimilar to that presented in the southern states.
Rivalry between jobbers in the East and provincial middlemen
in a little developed territory is in evidence in either case. The
St. Louis Business Men's League case best exemplifies this issue.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>Trade interests in this interior city wished to abolish all
distinction between carload and less-than-carload lots, for
the patent purpose of enabling them to sell direct throughout
the Pacific coast territory in competition with San Francisco
jobbers. The latter, on the other hand, demanded
that all less-than-carload ratings should be abolished on
transcontinental shipments; so that they might purchase
their goods by the carload and resell them in parcels. The
Commission, after fully weighing the evidence, decided that,
so far as carload differentials were concerned, the existing
scheme in 1902 was not abnormal as compared with other
portions of the country. On the other aspects of the matter,
such as the relativity of rates to Rocky mountain and Pacific
terminal points, no ruling was made. But the dissenting
opinion upon this point is significant, as we shall see, in that it
put forth the suggestion of a scheme of rates graded according
to distance,&mdash;a plan ten years later to be enforced by the
Commission under its amplified powers at law.</p>

<p>The welfare of the entire Rocky mountain belt of population,
and particularly its commercial centres, constitutes a
second phase of the problem of transcontinental rates.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The
whole chain of cities from Spokane on the north to the Mexican
border has been long and vitally interested in this matter.
Rates to these cities, elsewhere described,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> as well as from these
cities out in either direction, are very much higher than the
rates for longer distances through them and beyond. Thus,
for instance, in the case of Pueblo, it has been shown that bar
iron was hauled 2,400 miles from Chicago to San Francisco, for
fifty cents per one hundred pounds, and rails were hauled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>same distance for sixty cents; while for the haul from Pueblo,
Colorado, to San Francisco, only 1,500 miles, the rate on both
commodities was $1.60. Cotton piece goods were shipped
from Boston to Omaha for fifty-two cents per one hundred
pounds, with the added rate on to Denver of $1.25, giving an
aggregate of $1.77. In face of this, the rate through Denver
to California is only one dollar. The railways' defence for this
situation was that the low through rates were compelled by
water competition. But it is certainly difficult on this ground to
justify lower rates to Missouri river points than to Denver or
Salt Lake City. In other words, as urged in our chapter on
local discrimination,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> having once recognized the principle of
blanket rates as far west as Kansas City, there seemed to be
no reason why the limit should not be pushed further west.
All of these allied cases, however, were left unsettled for years,
owing to the lack of power on the part of the Interstate Commerce
Commission to enforce its decisions under the law as
then interpreted. With the new legislation since 1906, as will
be shown,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> a permanent and just solution of the matter is
promised at last.</p>

<p>The relations between the Canadian railways and the transcontinental
lines in the United States were for many years
unsatisfactory; and were oftentimes a source of serious disturbance
in the matter of rates. The Canadian Pacific claimed,
and was in fact accorded for some years, a differential or a lower
rate, in order to offset its disability in the matter of distance,
extra-territoriality, etc. Thus, for instance, in 1888 the Canadian
Pacific was allowed to quote rates thirty cents per one hundred
pounds below those by the standard lines. The rates
were afterwards increased on first-class traffic. The other roads
refused, after a time, to continue differentials at this figure, and
after a year the differential was reduced to twenty-eight cents
from the Atlantic seaboard. The question was bitterly contested
after that until 1892, when all agreements were abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>Since that time the Canadian Pacific has acted
independently, taking, as a rule, rates about ten per cent. less
than its competitors in American territory. The whole question
was submitted to arbitration in 1898, and by a divided opinion
two out of three of the arbitrators decided that the Canadian
Pacific Railway was not, nor should it be, entitled to a differential
under the rates made by the United States lines.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The
intricacy of the question is indicated by the non-concurrence in
this conclusion of so well recognized an authority as J. W.
Midgley. The railroads concerned having all agreed to acquiesce
in this decision, the situation has been far more
harmonious in this respect than for many years previous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A difficulty often arises in connection with the interruption
of a shipment of goods in order to subject it to some simple
process of manufacture. Shall the entire journey from producer
to consumer be considered as a unit in determination of
the rate; or shall the two parts, before and after the change of
form by manufacture, be considered as separate and distinct
in this regard? This problem arises in connection with the
so-called "milling-in-transit" system for grain.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Logs likewise

or other goods may be substituted at an intermediate point.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
And then, finally, there are the so-called "floating cotton"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>cases.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The principle at bottom is practically the same in all
of these sets of cases. It may be worth while briefly to consider
two of them.</p>

<p>The "milling in transit" system is simply that of according
to grain which is unloaded and milled at an intermediate point,
the low through rate from the point of origin to that of consumption.
Thus, for instance, wheat grown in North Dakota
may be unloaded and ground into flour at Minneapolis and
thence shipped to New York at the through rate from its point
of origin to New York. Oftentimes a very small charge, as,
for instance, one cent per one hundred pounds, is made for the
privilege. This system prevails throughout the southern states
also. Grain is brought, for instance, from Kansas City to
Nashville or Birmingham, milled there, and shipped farther
south for consumption. The rate charged is based upon the
entire haul from Kansas City to the local point where the flour
is consumed. Obviously this system stimulates very greatly
the development of the milling industry at intermediate points.
It is opposed correspondingly by the large cities which otherwise
enjoy special privileges in the matter of low rates.</p>

<p>Precisely the same principle is involved in what are known
as "floating cotton" rates. In this case the system has developed
of permitting cotton to be unloaded in transit and compressed
at an intermediate point, it being thereafter reshipped
to the point of destination at a through rate from its point of
origin. Thus, for example, cotton may be hauled twenty to
thirty miles to one of the larger towns. There it is unloaded,
sorted and compressed, reloaded, and sent on as if it had not
been interfered with at all. Obviously one rate for the entire
shipment is much less than the local rate into the town&mdash;which
is always very high&mdash;plus a second rate from that town
on to destination. The system in respect to cotton has developed
even further than that of milling in transit of grain;
for in the latter case the grain must be unloaded at some point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
on the line to destination; whereas in the case of cotton it may,
under rulings of the Interstate Commerce Commission, be
actually hauled <i>away</i> from its ultimate destination a number
of miles and then reshipped back over the same line though
at a lower rate than it could otherwise have enjoyed. Thus,
in a leading case decided in 1899 it was held by the Interstate
Commerce Commission that cotton could be hauled from
Gattman, Mississippi, forty-one miles northwest to Tupelo,
compressed there, and then hauled back again through Gattman
and Birmingham to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Important centres, such as Memphis, which formerly enjoyed
almost a monopoly of the compressing business, have
strenuously opposed the development of this system. On the
other hand, it offers a distinct advantage to the grower, because
in place of selling the cotton through cotton factors at Memphis
or other centres, it may be sorted and compressed at local
stations. By this means much expense in the matter of drayage,
handling and commissions is saved. This system is particularly
advantageous because it tends to break up the pernicious
basing point system, which tends to centralize all business at a
few important points in the southern states. Almost a complete
revolution in the matter of handling cotton has been
effected during the last few years by the growth of this practice.
Not only has the floating cotton system developed further than
that of milling in transit by according the right of shipping
even backward, away from the ultimate destination; it has
also permitted of liberality in the handling of the product itself.
It has been held that it is not even necessary for the same cotton
to be reshipped from the point of compression. A carload
started from the initial point for Boston, for example, may
never reach there, other cotton being substituted for it. The
destination of the car may be, and frequently is, changed. A
few dozen grades of cotton being on the market, the original
shipment into the point of compression may be entirely resorted
and distributed to a dozen different points. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
ownership of the cotton may change while it is in transit.
Nevertheless, the system has been held as valid under the law,
and its beneficial effects during the last few years have been
observable, especially in the southern states. Of late the danger
lurking in these systems of gross personal favoritism, have led
to their careful examination in a number of cases. What the
final policy regarding them is to be, cannot at this writing be
affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A problem of considerable difficulty, involving the relative
shares of the various seaports in American export business, has
occupied the attention of experts for more than a generation;
and at this present writing, although before the Interstate
Commerce Commission for the third time, seems to be almost
as far from a satisfactory solution as ever.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> It originated at
the time of the rate wars in 1876. The first agreement between
all the trunk lines concerning it was entered into in the following
year. By this an attempt was made to equalize the aggregate
cost of ocean and rail transportation between competing points
in the West and all foreign and domestic points reached through
Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Under this
agreement, Baltimore was allowed a rate of three cents below
the rate from Chicago to New York; Philadelphia enjoyed a
concession of two cents; while Boston had its rate fixed at a
certain percentage of the Chicago-New York figure. There
was considerable dissatisfaction expressed at various times
with these differentials, and the whole matter was submitted
to arbitration in 1882. The commercial interests of New York,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>as well as of the railroads centering in that city, have complained
bitterly that these differences, once adjusted upon a very much
higher scale of rates than at present, have become increasingly
burdensome now that the Chicago-New York rate is perhaps
not more than a third or a quarter of what it formerly was,
while the differential has remained at a fixed figure. The
recent decline of the export commerce of New York is, in fact,
ascribed in a large measure to the operation of these differentials;
and a leading case before the Interstate Commerce Commission,
instituted by the Produce Exchange of New York,
endeavored to secure their abolition. The Commission held,
however, that the differentials&mdash;recognized by the Joint
Traffic Association of 1896&mdash;were legitimately based upon
competitive relations of the carriers; and that consequently
no unlawful preference or advantage had been accorded to the
cities competing with New York for export business.</p>

<p>The result of pressure for a larger division of export business,
particularly from Boston, led, in 1899, to a reduction by one-half
of the differentials. The matter was finally submitted
for arbitration to the Interstate Commerce Commission, which
very fully examined the question and rendered a decision in
1905.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> By this decision rates <i>via</i> Philadelphia on traffic for
export were to be one cent less than by way of New York,
while to Baltimore they were to be two cents less. This arrangement
still left Boston subject to its former substantial
disability. It was contended that the original purpose of the
differentials, namely, equilibration of rates from western centres
of production through the various ports to Liverpool, had been
practically nullified. For a time the phenomenal development
of the Gulf exports diverted attention, forcing all the Atlantic
seaports to make common cause against their southern rivals.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
But the passing of this danger once more revived interest in
the struggle between the Atlantic cities. Opportunity for the
collection of full data under the strengthened Federal law in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>1906, made it possible to reopen the case in 1912 before the
Interstate Commerce Commission. But, in the meantime,
both in 1909 and 1911, after an interval of twenty years, trunk
line rate wars threatened to break out for the protection of
Boston against its rivals. The latest decision by the Commission,
just handed down,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> still fails to satisfy Boston. No differential
rate on export grain on the ground of distance as against
New York is conceded; but those already in effect at Philadelphia
and Baltimore are sanctioned. What the effect will
be, remains for the future to determine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principle involved in the so-called import and export
cases<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> is that of the reasonableness of charging lower rates on
goods originally shipped from or destined to domestic points,
than are charged for similar goods, over the same lines and for
the same distances, when brought from or destined to foreign
countries. Thus, for instance, in the case of cotton cloth
shipped by way of Pacific ports to the Orient, the practice is
not uncommon of charging a less rate to San Francisco for the
transportation of goods ultimately destined for export, than is
charged on similar goods which are to be unloaded for consumption
at San Francisco or other California points. Or,
reversing the case, this question touches the reasonableness of
transporting goods from New York to Chicago at a lower rate,
if they have been brought in from Europe, than is charged for
similar service in the case of goods that have originated at or
near New York. Cases of this description have become increasingly
frequent during the last twenty years. The first and
most important one, upon which both the Interstate Commerce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>Commission and the United States Supreme Court have passed,
originated in proceedings before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, brought by the New York Board of Trade of
Transportation against the Pennsylvania and other railroad
companies. The case practically raised the general question
whether, in the carriage of goods from American seaports,
carriers subject to the act could lawfully charge less for the
transportation of imported than of domestic traffic of like
kind to the same destination. The Commission, after careful
examination, held that such differences in rates constituted
discrimination as against the domestic shipper. According to
its view, the circumstances and conditions pertaining to the
carriage of freight from a foreign port to the United States
could not be considered as creating the dissimilarity of conditions
which alone would justify a different rate for like service
in the two cases. The Commission held that:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"One paramount purpose of the act to regulate commerce, manifest
in all its conditions, is to give to all dealers and shippers the same
rates for similar services rendered by the carrier in transporting
similar freight over its line. Now, it is apparent from the evidence
in this case that many American manufacturers, dealers, and localities,
in almost every line of manufacture and business, are the competitors
of foreign manufacturers, dealers, and localities for supplying the
wants of American consumers at interior places in the United States,
and that under domestic bills of lading they seek to require from American
carriers like service as their foreign competitors.... The act
to regulate commerce secures them this right. To deprive them of
it by any course of transportation business or device is to violate the
statute."</p></div>

<p>The Commission thereupon ordered the carriers to cease
and desist from making such discrimination. This order, while
obeyed by a number of carriers, was disregarded by the Texas
and Pacific Railway, which operated an import line from New
Orleans to San Francisco. Upon application by the Commission
this case was carried to the Supreme Court of the United
States for final adjudication. The Supreme Court decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
that the interpretation of the law by the Commission was
defective, although three members of the court, including the
Chief Justice, dissented from this opinion. As an illustration
of the discrimination which existed in this case it appeared that
the domestic rate on books, buttons, carpets, etc., from New
Orleans to San Francisco was $2.88 per one hundred pounds,
while the total through charge on the same articles from Liverpool
to San Francisco was only $1.07. The Supreme Court
distinctly refrained from an opinion as to the reasonableness of
these rates, and contented itself with passing upon the propriety
of any difference in rates whatever. It held that the
contention of the railroads was sound, namely, that all circumstances
and conditions, whether within the United States
or having regard for ocean rates and foreign competitive conditions,
must be considered. In other words, they recognized
the validity of the claim of the railroads that this import traffic
must be taken at an extremely low rate if at all, since otherwise
the goods would go by water around Cape Horn, or by another
route. On the basis of such reasoning it would appear that
any contribution from low import rates to the fixed charges of
the railroad would enable that road to transport its domestic
traffic at a lower rate than it otherwise might. What, however,
the majority of the court did not add, although it was developed
by the dissenting justices, was the fact that these conditions
might exclude domestic purchasers entirely from certain
markets, giving them over to importers who could control the
market by reason of the low rates accorded. Since this decision
in 1896 the railroads have still further developed this system of
discrimination. The only safeguard for the domestic producer
must lie, obviously, in some decision by a competent tribunal
as to the amount of such differences which may reasonably
exist. The Supreme Court has upheld their validity as a system,
but it still remains for the amount of such difference which
may be deemed reasonable, to be determined.</p>

<p>Identical in principle with the above described case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
although presenting reversed conditions, are the so-called
export rate cases. These have to do mainly with the rates
charged on products for domestic consumption as against like
products for export. As an illustration of the extent of such
differences, it was clearly shown before the Industrial Commission
that at times the freight rate on wheat from Kansas
City to Galveston was twenty-seven cents per one hundred
pounds if for domestic consumption, while the proportion of
an export rate for a similar service was ten cents.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The rate
on wheat from the Mississippi river to New York for domestic
consumption was at times twenty or twenty-one cents per
one hundred pounds, while for the same service when the goods
were to be exported, the rate would be thirteen cents per one
hundred pounds. This system of stimulating foreign business
by discriminatingly low rates seems to have attained large
proportions only since 1897. The Interstate Commerce Commission
took cognizance of the system in a decision rendered
in 1899.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> It was enabled to do so by virtue of the Import
Rate decision above cited, whereby the United States Supreme
Court authorized it to consider not only circumstances and
conditions within the United States, but also those relating
to ocean transport and foreign competition.</p>

<p>The railroads justify their action on the ground that only
by making such concessions in export rates could they lay down
grain in foreign markets in competition with other parts of the
world. On the other hand, it was not made clear why such
competition from foreign markets had become any more acute
in the last few years than prior to that time. There appears
to be much force in the argument of many shippers, and also
of some railroad men, that this anomalous condition of rates
was due, not so much to the keenness of foreign competition,
as to the rivalry among the American carriers themselves. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>other words, it was said that the competition between the Gulf
ports and the Atlantic ports was responsible for the abnormally
low rates on export business. In line with this argument would
seem to be the fact that it is the rates upon wheat and not
upon flour for export, which have decreased more than in
proportion to the decrease upon similar commodities for
domestic consumption. The passing of the acutest phase of
competition from the Gulf ports since 1906, has rendered these
questions of lesser interest of late years. They may at any
time be revived, but seem unlikely to regain the importance
which they formerly assumed.</p>

<p>The course of freight rates in the United States during the
last generation divides naturally into two periods, before and
after 1900, respectively.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Prior to that date an almost uninterrupted
decline took place, which has been followed by a strongly
marked upward tendency during the last decade. In respect
of freight rates this movement is commonly judged in either
of two ways; by comparison of actual rates charged for
specified service between given points through a series of years;
or, secondly, by means of what is called the revenue per ton
mile. Considering first the use of this latter index, the course
of events is shown by means of the diagram opposite the next
page, covering the period between 1867 and 1910. But before
conclusions may safely be drawn from this showing, it is imperative
that the true significance of revenue per ton mile statistics
should be set forth. For a generation, and particularly in
connection with the Roosevelt legislation in 1906, volumes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>written and oral evidence upon moot questions were based upon
such figures. Specious and misleading reasoning upon a public
question was perhaps never more common in the course of our
history.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> It is most important to understand clearly the real
significance of this common statistical unit. We shall then,
only, be in position to interpret the diagram properly.</p>

<p>The revenue per ton mile for a given road, or for the railway
system of the United States, is computed by dividing the
total freight revenue for that service, whatever it may be, by
the number representing the amount of freight in tons hauled
one mile. Thus, for example, if the total freight revenue of
a system of roads be $900,000,000, this having been received as
compensation for hauling an equivalent of 90,000,000,000 tons
of freight one mile, the compensation actually received for each
ton hauled one mile is obviously one cent. All that is necessary
in order to compute the average revenue per ton mile,
then, is to know the total freight revenue and the amount of
ton mileage service. Computed in this way the average revenue
per ton per mile for the railways of the United States in 1867 was
1.92 cents. From this level a decline took place in 1890 to 0.941
cents&mdash;that is to say, the average amount received for each
ton of freight hauled one mile had declined about one half.
Since about 1897 there has been no considerable change, the
corresponding figure for 1911 being 0.757 cents. In other words,
at the present time the carriers of the United States receive
about three-fourths of a cent for each ton-mile service. From
a revenue point of view this unit may seem insignificant in
amount; but it should be borne in mind, of course, that it is
applied to an immense volume of traffic. Even the slight increase
between 1900 and the present time, if applied to the
volume of traffic now existing, would make a difference in freight
revenue for the entire railway system of the United States of
approximately $61,000,000.</p>

<p>Measurement of the course of freight rates by means of revenue
per ton mile possesses one great advantage. It measures
the <i>actual</i> return received by the railway without regard to the
published tariff, showing accurately, therefore, the degree to
which any departures from the published rates take place. For
this reason the foregoing diagram probably under-indicates the
extent, relatively, of the decline before 1900. For it is indubitable
that the published rates have been very much more
nearly observed with the passage of time during this decade.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
On the other hand, revenue per ton mile, as thus used for
general purposes, is open to a number of very serious objections.
Obviously, like any statistical average it fails to represent the
actual payment for any given service. But its disadvantages
are more deeply seated than this. Entirely irrespective of any
change in the level of rates, revenue per ton mile is affected
fundamentally by three distinct sets of conditions. It varies
according to the nature of the traffic, whether high grade or low;
it is affected by the length of the haul and the proportion of
local as distinct from through business; and it is modified profoundly
according to the volume of traffic handled.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the consideration of the above mentioned
factors, attention may be directed to the following table,
which gives the extreme range of ton-mile revenue for a number
of different railways arranged in groups according to the nature
of their business.</p>

<p>Each group is graded, moreover, within itself according to
the revenue per ton mile. From this showing it appears that
for 1910 the range above and below the average for the United
States is considerable&mdash;being upwards of three times as great
for the New Haven system as for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio, which
comes at the foot of the list. It will now be in order to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
the reasons for these wide variations, which are by no means,
as is customarily assumed in public discussion, conditioned
even primarily by the level or reasonableness of the freight
rates charged. Until these attendant circumstances are fully
understood, any conclusions as to relative freight rates for
a given service based upon revenue per ton mile, are entirely
misleading.</p>

<p>The nature of the traffic handled by a carrier is the most
important consideration to be kept in mind in interpreting revenue
per ton mile data. This is most clearly shown by comparison
in the table between the group of coal and ore roads
and the New England systems. The revenue per unit of service
on a road whose traffic is largely of low grade most necessarily
be low. Probably the lowest average ever reported in the
United States was for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio in 1899&mdash;the
low point in the general movement of freight rates&mdash;when its
ton-mile revenue touched O.362 cents. Whenever the business
of a carrier consists largely of coal, grain, lumber or other low-grade
commodities on which the freight charges must necessarily
be exceedingly low in order that the freight shall move
at all, the revenue per ton mile must consequently stand at a
low figure. Bald comparison of any such revenue with a corresponding
figure for high-grade roads is obviously misleading
and fallacious. It does not mean that the latter necessarily
charges more for the same service; but its higher revenue per
ton of freight moved one mile may be, and very likely is, merely
due to the fact that much of its tonnage is capable of bearing
higher charges. From this circumstance it also follows that
comparisons from year to year either for single roads or for the
entire railway net, must be made in the light of variations in
the proportion of high and low grade tonnage. The trend seems
to have been steadily downward in this regard year by year.
A steady increase, relatively, in the volume of low-grade traffic
has long been under way.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The development of the last twenty years in the United
States has certainly been in favor of a great increase in low-grade
traffic. This is shown by the following table, giving the per
cent. of tonnage in various classes upon the trunk lines from
New York to and beyond Chicago.</p>

<p>From this it appears that "sixty per cent. of the tonnage is
now (1893) carried in fourth, fifth and sixth classes.... Prior
to 1886 no considerable number of articles were permanently
assigned to the fifth and sixth classes; they embraced usually a
few commodities which had been assigned a special rate."
Further consideration of this table shows that first-class freight,
forming thirty per cent. of the tonnage in 1878, declined to less
than twenty per cent. in 1892; while at the same time sixth-class
freight ran up from nothing to 43.4 per cent. in 1892.
Fourth-class freight declined during the same period from 57.9
to 10.4 per cent. These figures simply mean that a great deal
of traffic is now carried upon American railways for long distances
which a generation ago it was believed could not be
profitably moved at all. The utility of the railway service,
once supposedly confined entirely to freight of the higher classes,
has been gradually extended until today there is no commodity
too cheap to be handled with the improved facilities. This
vast increase in the amount of low-grade traffic is undoubtedly
responsible to some degree for the apparent decline of freight
rates so often instanced. Fortunately upon this point we have
the specific testimony of traffic managers of long experience.
On the other hand, in justice to the railways it must be admitted
that the proportion of local business at high rates, which would
tend to increase the average revenue per ton mile, has steadily
increased with the growth of the country; and, moreover, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
already been shown, in times of exceptional prosperity the movement
of high-grade freight has increased in more than its due
proportion.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Nor are these facts adduced in criticism of American
railway policy. They are simply intended to draw attention
to the fact that, while changes of freight rates have
undoubtedly been considerable, they have not been as great as is
oftentimes plausibly stated. As for comparisons with foreign
countries, they are practically invalidated by the difference
in local conditions, as, for instance, in England where local
delivery is involved. In the United States such service is
charged in addition, either as drayage or express.</p>

<p>The increased diversification in the freight tonnage of American
railways, always in the direction of a larger proportion
of traffic from general business rather than from the movement
of staple commodities, is also of great fiscal significance. It
means not only more business, but better and more permanent
traffic. The difference, moreover, between the charge which
high-grade freight, such as merchandise, will bear by comparison
with the highest rate upon grain or coal, is much greater than any
difference in the cost of service. The profit, therefore, attendant
upon the movement of traffic other than low-grade commodities
is strikingly great; although, of course, profitableness
is a question of relativity between operating cost and revenue.
Heavy train loads of coal at 4 mills per ton mile may be
better business than merchandise in light carloads at a rate
five times as high. At all events the tendency toward
higher grade tonnage has been notable, especially since
1900. Many western roads and even the trunk lines, formerly
dependent in a great measure upon the movement of crops,
are now affected only indirectly in this regard, by reason of
their influence upon general business. The growing diversification
of traffic because of its financial importance merits
more concrete illustration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>
<p>The Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern, during the calendar
year 1900, increased its freight traffic by 1,760,000 tons. Of
this only 194,000 tons were specified as products of agriculture
and animals, while products of the forests actually declined by
84,000 tons. In other words, nearly all of this phenomenal
increase in business in 1900 was due to the movement of manufactures,
minerals and merchandise. A comparison made for
the last three decades makes this point still more clear. Since
1880 there has been very little increase in agricultural tonnage
upon this trunk line, with an actual decrease in the movement
of grain. This, perhaps, may be in part explained by the great
development of grain traffic upon the lakes, which, of course,
absorbs much business formerly carried by this road. In other
words, farm products and provisions transported by the Lake
Shore rose from 3,465,000 tons in 1880 to only 3,843,000 tons in
1900. The movement of petroleum and lumber actually decreased,
owing to the construction of pipe lines and the clearing
of the forests. On the other hand, manufactures and merchandise
increased threefold in volume, rising from 3,754,000 tons
in 1880 to 14,932,000 tons in 1900. Whereas agricultural products
in 1880 formed over forty per cent. of the traffic upon the
Lake Shore, they constituted in 1900 less than twenty per cent.
Much the same tendency is manifested by other routes. Thus
for the fiscal year 1901, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio reported substantial
decreases in the actual tonnage of flour, grain, sand,
stone, iron, etc.; but a largely augmented movement of general
merchandise of the higher classes. Many of the soft-coal roads,
such as the Cleveland, Lorain &amp; Wheeling, which used to carry
nearly two-thirds of their tonnage in the form of coal, now carry
less than forty per cent. A feature of importance in the great
prosperity of the anthracite coal roads has been a steady increase
in the volume of their general traffic as distinct from coal tonnage.
All over the country, in short, the steady growth of
population and the decline in the proportion of grain for export
is reducing, relatively, the importance of low-grade tonnage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
supplanting it by a movement of supplies and merchandise in
the contrary direction.</p>

<p>Conclusions from these figures are well worth noting. The
importance, measured by traffic rather than revenue, of low-grade
freight classed as products of mines, is notable. This
forms more than half the aggregate tonnage for the United
States, and has appreciably increased within the last ten years.
In 1910 it constituted almost two-thirds of the business in trunk
line territory and almost one-half in the West. Products of
agriculture, on the other hand, even in western territory, amount
to less than one-fifth of the total tonnage. These facts indicate
clearly the diverse conditions under which railways operate in
different parts of the country. The next table,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> besides incidentally
throwing more light upon the relative tonnage of
staple commodities, will suffice to establish our main point&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>namely,
that the nature of the traffic vitally affects all ton mile
revenue statistics. It entirely, in fact, overshadows mere
changes in the general level of freight rates. Any argument
concerning the movement of such charges, which fails
to correct fully for this factor, may be dismissed at once as
valueless.</p>

<p>A second consideration in the interpretation of ton mile
data, of equal importance with the nature of the traffic, is the
length of the haul and the proportion of local as distinct from
through business. This necessarily follows from the nature of
a distance tariff. Only on condition that the rate augmented
in direct proportion to the increase of distance, would the
revenue per ton mile remain constant. The diagram at page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>
is instructive in this connection. The charges&mdash;denoted by
the height of the curve at any given point&mdash;tend to grow much
less rapidly than distance. In other words, the rate curve
approaches a parabolic form, until after a certain point it becomes
practically a flat rate, independent of distance. This
fact of necessity causes ton-mile revenue to decrease steadily
with the length of the haul. For ton-mile revenue is but the
ratio of the abscissa to the ordinate of the curve at any given
point; the former being the rate charged, the latter the distance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>
<p>In practice, therefore, the longer the haul in general, the lower
is the revenue per ton mile.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> This is clearly shown by comparison
of the two items for given roads, otherwise similarly circumstanced,
in the table already discussed on page&nbsp;<a href="#Page_415">415</a>.</p>

<p>Closely akin to the length of haul in affecting ton-mile revenue,
is the proportion of local traffic. This also is in practice
vital. Obviously it costs much more to handle local business,
the terminal expenses being far greater in proportion. And at
the same time a larger proportion of the freight moves in small
lots locally. This difference between revenue per ton mile
for local business and through traffic is very great. On the
Louisville &amp; Nashville, for example, in 1886, it was 1.48 cents
for the former, as against .99 cents for through business.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> The
Illinois Central in 1900 reported an average revenue per ton
mile on through freight of 0.48 cents, while for local freight the
corresponding figure was 1.17 cents, the average of both being
0.56 cents. It is apparent, therefore, that any accurate determination
of the level of charges in general must take account of
such facts as these.</p>

<p>Any carrier like the Southern Pacific, the Chesapeake &amp;
Ohio or the Erie, with relatively little local traffic and a business
dependent largely upon the long haul, will conduct transportation
for a materially lower figure than roads in a densely
settled territory. This consideration was recently illustrated
in Massachusetts experience.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The Fitchburg Railroad, devoted
to long distance, low-grade business by the Hoosac tunnel
route, was consolidated with the Boston &amp; Maine in 1900. Its
revenue per ton mile was formerly .818 cents based upon such
traffic. When it was merged with the Boston &amp; Maine,&mdash;considerably
blessed as it is with local traffic,&mdash;the latter's ton-mile
revenue fell from 1.44 cents in 1900 to 1.158 cents in the fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>lowing
year. There had been no change whatever in freight
rates.</p>

<p>A word may be interposed in this connection as to the peculiar
movement of local as distinguished from through rates
through a series of years. Local charges have decreased
relatively little, probably because of the absence of competition
in such cases. They have, moreover, decreased very unevenly
in different parts of the country. Apparently one of the first
and most beneficent results of the enactment of the Act to Regulate
Commerce in 1887, was a reduction of local rates in various
parts of the country, in order to bring the rate adjustment into
conformity with the long and short haul clause. This was
peculiarly the case in the northeastern or trunk line territory.
It does not seem to have occurred in the southern states, where
the long and short haul principle has never been accepted in its
entirety. The most comprehensive report upon the subject
concludes that local rates have in various parts of the country,
during the last quarter century, been reduced from ten to fifty
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Returns from various railway commissions interrogated
by the Industrial Commission in 1900 upon the subject
showed highly variable results. From Mississippi it appeared
that "local freight rates in this state have been materially
lowered in the last four years, especially in the lettered classes";
while in the adjoining state of Alabama "local rates on freight
have decreased very little in the last five or six years, and have
not decreased in proportion to the decrease made in interstate
rates." In New England, comparison of actual freight rates
did not indicate any very considerable reduction, the absence
of competition in this section being, perhaps, in part responsible
for this result. A comparison of published freight rates in
southern territory, without making allowance for departures
from such tariffs, apparently showed a very much smaller reduction
than in other parts of the country. It is also apparently
true that the reduction of cotton rates in this section, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>considerable, had been much less rapid than that of the rates
upon grain from Chicago to the seaboard in either direction.
A few instances of an actual rise of local charges since 1900 may
be cited.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> But the fact that competition has been substantially
eliminated in consequence of widespread consolidation since
1900, has rendered the movement of local and through freight
rates more nearly alike all over the country than they were
prior to that time.</p>

<p>The third consideration which must always be kept in mind
in the interpretation of revenue per ton mile is the volume of
the traffic handled. Any comparison of freight rates which is
not made in the light of increase in the business transacted, is
bound to be misleading. A reduction of cost of operation per
unit, attending a growth in volume, has already been fully described
in connection with the theory of rates. And it is but
natural that a reduction in the rate should follow any lessening
of cost. Moreover, a large volume of business usually implies
a relatively greater amount of low-grade tonnage. In order to
bring out this relationship the second column in the table on
page <a href="#Page_415">415</a> has been added. This permits a correlation between
freight density&mdash;that is to say, ton miles per mile of line and
revenue per unit of service. It will be noted that, in general,
the revenue unit falls as the volume of traffic, measured by
freight density, rises. This is strikingly shown by comparison
of the groups of western and transcontinental roads with those
concerned mainly with the carriage of coal and ore. The soft
coal Hocking Valley road with its enormous density and very
low revenue per ton mile, affords an excellent example. It
is indubitable that the trunk lines and the coal roads are able
to transact business for relatively low rates, not only because
their tonnage is of low grade, long haul or both; but also because
of its immense concentration per mile of line, permitting all of
the economies incident to large-scale operation. In this connection,
however, it should be noted as a general principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
that oftentimes it is not the mere increase in the traffic of a
particular sort which is significant; but rather the growth in
the total volume of business of all kinds.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing criticism of the use of revenue per ton mile
as a means of showing the course of freight rates in general has
been mainly destructive. This figure, nevertheless, will in
many cases be found highly serviceable in the examination of
particular rates. It may properly be used to determine whether
a given commodity is contributing its due proportion to the
general budget of the carrier. Revenue per ton mile can, of
course, be computed for each particular service; inasmuch as
both the income and the volume of that service are matters of
independent record. The table on page <a href="#Page_421">421</a> brings out this
point. Or take a division of the Illinois Central for 1900. Its
revenue per ton mile was 0.136 cents on wheat, 0.79 cents on
flour, 4.267 cents on sugar-cane, 0.309 cents on soft coal, 1.148
cents on stone and sand, 2.238 cents on furniture, 3.165 cents on
merchandise. On this basis one may properly inquire as to
whether under all the circumstances wheat, coal or merchandise
are doing their part, in the light of the particular expenses attached
to their carriage, in maintaining the general burden of
indivisible costs. When copper yields a revenue per ton mile
of only 0.285 cents, the rate being only 1.6 per cent. of its market
value, while on wheat for the same haul the corresponding
unit of return is 0.4 cents per ton mile&mdash;equal to one-fifth of its
worth&mdash;there is evidently a maladjustment favoring one
commodity over another.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> In a number of recent cases questions
of this sort have been rather satisfactorily answered by
resort to this unit of measurement.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>The curve of revenue per ton mile, as shown by diagram
at the head of this chapter, certainly gives no indication of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>the considerable increase of freight rates which has ensued
since 1900. This follows from the fact that in at least two
of the three respects, above mentioned, the trend of events,
independent of any change in the level of freight rates, has
operated to greatly dilute the revenue per ton mile. The growth
of low-grade traffic and the immense augmentation in tonnage
have both conspired to render this unit entirely useless for
purposes of comparison year by year. The average length of
haul alone seems to have remained much the same during the
decade. Although the curve does not show it, there has been a
notable upward movement all along the line, responsible, as we
shall see, for much of the new Federal legislation. How may we,
then, estimate the amount of these increases? Under such circumstances,
it is necessary to turn to the movement of actual
rates.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The course of these down to 1900 is best shown upon
the same diagram above mentioned by means of the dotted
curve, entitled Actual Rate Index, the scale for which is given at
the right. This rate index is simply the average of the actual
published rates for a number of specific commodities between
certain given points. It differs in principle from the ton mileage
revenue curve, in that it concerns merely the <i>published</i>
rates, taking no account of rebates or departures from those
rates in actual practice. A comparison of its course with that
of the ton mileage curve shows a more abrupt decline from
about 1878 to 1886, since which year the course of both lines is
about parallel. Its irregularity is also significant as illustrating
the violent fluctuations to which the published rates were subjected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>jected prior to 1887. Judged by this curve, the situation has
been more settled since the enactment of the Act to Regulate
Commerce in 1887.</p>

<p>Were data at hand for a continuation of this line to 1910 it
would undoubtedly afford a fairly reliable measure, in general,
of the substantial increase of rates which has taken place during
the decade. The main objection to it would be that it did not
weight the average according to the volume of the business carried
for each of the thirty-seven concrete rates chosen.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>Tracing the rise of actual rates since 1900 is rendered peculiarly
difficult, also, by reason of the fact that few of the changes
took the form of an outright advance in charges. The end in
view was more often accomplished surreptitiously. The substantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
increases in 1900<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> which inaugurated the upward
movement were mainly accomplished by changes of classification.
Modification of the carload ratings brought about the
same result. A notable instance appeared in the complaint of
the dairy men in Wisconsin in 1909. An annual shipment of
38,000,000 lbs. of cheese to Chicago before 1899 moved at
twenty cents per one hundred pounds, irrespective of the size
of the consignment. Ten years later the rate had become
twenty-eight cents for less-than-carload lots, and twenty-two and
one-half cents for wholesale shipments. The relative disability
of the small shipper under the new circumstances is as significant
as the rise of rate for all.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> The increase of charges might
be brought about in another way without actually advancing
rates by a withdrawal of commodity ratings, thereby subjecting
the shipper to the higher scale of classified commodities.
And, finally, a practical elimination of the rebate and the cessation
of general rate wars has usually resulted in a very substantial
increase in the revenue of the carriers as well as in the scale
of charges imposed upon most shippers. Evidence upon this
point is officially given in connection with the rate increases of
1903.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> It thus appears that to follow step by step the movement
of actual rates is an extremely complicated matter. Every
factor entering into the determination of the charge must be
considered; the distance tariff, the classification, minimum
carload rules and a host of other specifications which enter into
the final result. For our purposes it must suffice that the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>of a substantial rise of charges since the turning point in 1900
is beyond question.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> On the other hand, it is indubitable that
such increases as have occurred, arousing vehement protest
among shippers, have been more widely advertised than changes
in the opposite direction. Substantial reductions, especially on
low-grade staples, have sometimes occurred. One is almost at
a loss to strike a fair balance between the two, in the absence
of dependable data.</p>

<p>The movement of passenger fares has been quite different
from that of freight rates.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> No marked decline during the last
quarter of the nineteenth century took place. Growth in the
volume of traffic was not accomplished by a reduction of charges.
This is in consonance with the experience of foreign countries.
Passenger business, while steadily growing, has increased less
rapidly than freight tonnage. Generally, in other words, as
measured by volume, freight business has become relatively
more important with the progress of time. Fiscally the same
thing is true. Only in New England does the revenue from
this service approximate one-half of the total net earnings.
The nature of railway competition explains why passenger fares
have not decreased as rapidly as freight rates. Persons must
necessarily be more or less directly transported from one point
to another; while experience shows that competition in freight
traffic may be exceedingly circuitous in route, goods even going
hundreds of miles out of the direct line for transportation by
water. This narrowing of the sphere of competition in the
case of passengers has consequently operated to lessen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>rate of decline. Another point to be considered in this connection
is that no such increasing economies in the handling of
passengers are possible as in the case of freight. Instead of decreasing
the proportion of dead weight, which for passengers
amounts to upward of ninety per cent., by any of the economies
recently applied to freight traffic, it appears rather that the
proportion of dead weight of equipment per passenger is increasing,
owing to the necessity of providing more sumptuous
accommodations. Bearing in mind all these facts, it appears
not unreasonable that the progressive decline of passenger fares
has continually lagged behind the decrease of freight rates.
But the natural lethargy in the movement of passenger fares
was rudely interrupted in 1908 in connection with the wave of
legislation accompanying the Roosevelt campaign which culminated
in the Mann-Elkins law. A widespread demand for
lower passenger fares found expression in the passage by twenty-two
states within five years of maximum fare laws. Eleven
legislatures fixed the charge at two cents per mile, the others
establishing it at less than three cents. Many appeals to the
courts in connection with these statutes took place on the ground
of confiscation, and sharp conflicts of authority between Federal
and state governments arose.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Whether passenger rates would
ever have declined without such exercise of authority is open to
question, but the disturbance of established conditions at this
time was extreme.</p>

<p>One further question with relation to the movement of rates
merits consideration. In how far has the rise since 1900 been
commensurate with the general upward movement of prices of
other commodities than transportation&mdash;the particular commodity
produced by railways? The evidence tends to show that
prices in general have moved upward during the last ten years
by approximately one-fourth, and it may be even one-third.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
Have railway charges in general surpassed this rate or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>Some activity of railway experts has been devoted of late to the
elucidation of this question.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> But, after all, is this inquiry of
basic importance as bearing upon the general reasonableness
of railway rates? Here, as so often elsewhere in the discussion of
these questions, the need is for the analysis of such problems
with reference to particular services and not in connection with
matters in general.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> It is conceivable that railway rates might
and properly ought to increase under certain circumstances
much more than in proportion to the general change in freight
rates; or that, on the other hand, they might fairly be compelled
to lag behind. This introduces the larger question of reasonable
rates in general which must remain for discussion in our second

<p>The general level of rates affects the ultimate consumer
more than the shipper. Steadiness of rates, on the other hand,
is vital to a healthy state of trade. It is important to examine
the evidence from this point of view. The history of railroad
rates shows a steady improvement in the direction of more
general observance of published tariffs. Periods of abject demoralization
incidental to the most furious rate wars, have
alternated with periods of peace, characterized by more or less
faithful observance of agreed rates. Viewed in a large way the
intervals of disturbance have become less frequent and less
intense with the passage of time. Present conditions are more
satisfactory than any which have prevailed since 1850.</p>

<p>Rate wars are almost as old as railroading and are coincident
with the appearance of competition. Among the earliest
of note were the struggles between the Erie and the New York
Central as soon as the former road was constructed to Dunkirk,
Ohio, on the Great Lakes. But the most notorious rate wars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>were those which prevailed between the trunk lines in respect of
the carriage of grain to the seaboard. These wars began with
the entrance of the trunk lines into Chicago in 1869.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The
Baltimore and Ohio from the outset was the disturbing factor.
Having no entry into New York except over the lines of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, the refusal of the latter in 1874 to give
proper facilities led to immediate retaliation by rate cutting on
the Baltimore and Ohio. The details of these wars and their
economic significance have become classics in our American
industrial history. Suffice it to say that for intensity and
persistence these contests which lasted for ten years after 1884,
have been unequalled in our history since that time. A brief
period of calm ensued after 1876. But soon the struggle broke
out again in 1881, intensified by the construction of new parallel
trunk lines like the West Shore and the Nickel Plate. These
latter rate disturbances lasted for about three years.</p>

<p>The passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce in 1887 greatly
improved the rate situation for a time;<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> but harmonious relations
were rudely shaken by a bitter rate war in 1888 between
the Grand Trunk Railway and the American Lines with reference
to the rates upon dressed beef. Trouble over this traffic
had occurred as far back as 1879, when the rate from Chicago to
New York had been cut from one dollar to forty-five cents.
In 1888, however, the rate on dressed beef for weeks was as low
as six cents per hundred pounds. The Grand Trunk which had
carried almost half of this business in 1887, had its proportion
reduced to twenty-eight per cent. in the following year. At
this time also extensive rate wars prevailed in the far western
territory. The failure of the Atchison Road brought to light
accumulated rebates for the four years prior to 1894 to the
amount of $3,700,000. The prosperity of the early nineties
led to a considerable improvement in rate observances. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>only exception was the persistence of trouble from the Canadian
carriers. The Soo line across the Straits of Mackinac, opening
a short route from St. Paul and Minneapolis to the seaboard,
was acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railroad in 1890. Combined
lake-and-rail grain rates were sadly disturbed and the
controversy over so-called ex-Lake grain between the lines from
Buffalo to New York, which afterward cropped out in 1900,
took its beginning. These Canadian Pacific rate wars were
severe while they lasted. In 1892, for instance, the rate on boots
and shoes from Boston to St. Paul dropped from one dollar and
fifteen cents per hundredweight to forty-five cents.</p>

<p>The panic and subsequent depression of 1893 caused serious
and widespread rate wars all over the country. Grain rates
from Chicago to New York were openly reduced from twenty-five
to fifteen cents. Two peculiarities of this rate war deserve
mention. In the first place, every concession was publicly
made,&mdash;that is to say, the cut rates were filed with the Interstate
Commerce Commission; and, consequently, owing to the
percentage-basis system to intermediate points, the rate war on
Chicago-New York business automatically induced a rate war
to every intermediate point in Central Traffic Association
territory. Transcontinental rates were also badly upset at the
same time. This was due not only to the prevalent hard times,
but to complications arising from the independence of the
Panama Railway. This line had been controlled since 1871
by the Union Pacific Railroad. The arrangement under which
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company was also controlled came
to an end in 1893, when the field was again opened to competition.
The merchants of San Francisco established an independent
line of steamships and for two years the most bitter
and reckless rate war prevailed. During this conflict freight
was carried from New York to San Francisco as low as thirty
cents per hundredweight.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Matters were finally settled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>1898; but in the meantime the Union Pacific Railroad had gone
into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Entire demoralization in freight rates throughout the
southern states occurred in 1894. Every carrier in this section
was involved. Rates were cut for two months by as much as
two-thirds. The first-class rate from New York to Atlanta
dropped from $1.14 to forty cents per hundred pounds. The
years 1894-1895 for the country as a whole were exceedingly
unfortunate. Better conditions then supervened except for a
rate war on grain at Missouri river points, so important that it
was made the subject of special investigation.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The Chicago
Great Western Railroad through the agency of a corporation
known as the Iowa Development Company actually purchased
on its own account large amounts of grain in order to secure
its carriage. Grain was carried from Kansas City to Chicago
under the system of rebating known as "protecting the through
rate" for as low as two cents, when the open published rate was
seventeen cents per hundredweight. Conditions then bettered
somewhat largely through the activities of the Joint Traffic and
Trans-Missouri Freight Associations. The prospect of legalization
of pooling by Congress was bright. Rates seem to have
been observed with more than usual faithfulness throughout
the country, the only exception being another brief conflict
in the southern states. But the Trans-Missouri decision by
the United States Supreme Court in 1897, declaring these
traffic associations illegal, once more precipitated most unsatisfactory
conditions. And these were accentuated by the
budding prosperity of the following year.</p>

<p>With the return of activity in business and agriculture in
1898 a frenzy for participation in the rapidly expanding traffic
once more brought about extreme disorganization. The
Interstate Commerce Commission reported that "a large part
of the business at the present time is transacted upon illegal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
rates ... in certain quarters the observance of the published rate
is the exception." The commissioner of the St. Louis Traffic
Bureau testified before the United States Industrial Commission
that "there were fewer rates maintained in 1898 than at
any other time within my knowledge of the railroad business,
and I have been in the railroad business for twenty-eight years."
At this point the Interstate Commerce Commission intervened
by the proffer of its good offices. Conferences with the heads
of the principal railroads were held. A decided change in the
attitude of the Commission toward the carriers became evident.
It wisely sought to arouse the railroads themselves to the
enormity of the existing evils, being absolutely unable itself
under the law either to prevent or correct the existing abuses.
The result fully justified all expectations. The following year
witnessed an almost complete restoration of published rates,
although business continued to expand in volume. Naturally
there was ample for all the railroads to handle. This condition
lasted for some time. But during 1900 rate cutting again developed
upon a large scale in westbound business. The great
increase of eastbound shipments and the demand for return
lading at any price was undoubtedly the cause. This condition
lasted for some months.</p>

<p>Rate cutting between the trunk lines again broke out in the
spring of 1901, grain being hauled as low as eleven cents per
hundred pounds from Chicago to New York. Competition
between the Lake line railroads seems to have been the cause.
The problem of adjusting ex-Lake grain rates dates from this
period. The community-of-interest plan of trunk line control
was ineffective to prevent disturbance. In the same year a
passenger rate war from the Missouri river to California was
also threatened. The United States Industrial Commission
sent out a number of inquiries concerning conditions in the
summer of 1901. This indicated a firm and stable rate condition
in the East but some disturbance on lines between Chicago and
the Ohio river points. Trouble soon broke out, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
The Atchison road suspecting its competitors of bad faith, cut
its rates first-class from Chicago to the Missouri river from
eighty cents to fifty cents per hundredweight. Agreements
were repeatedly made and almost immediately violated, some
of the strongest lines being the worst offenders. During the
fall of that year export rates on flour and grain were badly
slashed. The traffic manager of the New York Central lines
testified that grain rates for export were not maintained for a
number of months.</p>

<p>Apparently the general situation in 1900 was more satisfactory
than at any previous time in the history of railroading
in the United States. With few exceptions the published rates
were observed. This commendable situation seems to have
been due to several causes. Primarily an adequate appreciation
by the railroads themselves of the losses of revenue to which
they had voluntarily subjected themselves prevailed. An
enormous volume of traffic incident to general prosperity, also,
almost overtaxed the facilities of the carriers. And, in the
third place, the spread of consolidation and the community-of-interest
idea undoubtedly contributed to the same end. The
determined attitude taken by important roads, notably the
Southern Railway, contributed to the maintenance of rates.
Even in the Far West and Northwest, rate conditions seemed to
be in better shape than at almost any previous time. But
it was too good to last; trouble soon broke out again. Grain
rates from Kansas to Chicago during the summer dropped
from nineteen cents to seven cents. Rates on packing-house
products became utterly demoralized. So bad did conditions
become that in March of 1902 the Interstate Commerce Commission
intervened, seeking injunctions in the Federal courts
against any departure from the published tariffs. This immediately
bettered conditions; and in February of 1903 the
passage of the Elkins law, as we shall see, contributed still
further to this end. The enactment of this statute, passed at
the solicitation of the carriers themselves and imposing much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
severer penalties upon departure from published rates, brought
about conditions during the spring of 1903 unsurpassed for
stability. The only exception was a minor disturbance concerning
the carriage of ex-Lake grain from Buffalo to New York.
Tariffs seem to have been faithfully maintained throughout the
country with one exception, that is to say, concerning traffic to
and from Missouri river points.</p>

<p>Since the passage of the Elkins Amendments in 1903, the
phenomenal development of export trade through the Gulf
Ports, principally New Orleans and Galveston,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> has been
mainly responsible for recurring and often ferocious rate wars,
particularly during the years 1903-1906. These rate wars were
usually precipitated in the first instance by struggles between
the Gulf railroads and the trunk lines for the carriage of export
corn. In 1904, for example, after a long period during which
little surplus corn was available for export from Iowa, Kansas
and Nebraska, much of it being locally consumed for stock
feeding, a large surplus was left over. Rates were promptly
cut during 1905 by both sets of lines. Thus the rate on export
corn from Omaha to New Orleans was reduced from eighteen
to eleven cents per hundred pounds. This cut was promptly
met by a reduction of rates from Missouri river points to Chicago
from twenty-four to thirteen cents. The rate from Omaha to
New York dropped to the extraordinarily low figure of thirteen
cents per hundred pounds. The Burlington and Missouri
Pacific Railroads were particularly active in this contest; together
securing over eighty per cent. of the corn traffic, although
five other important roads were operating in this territory.
All through the winter and spring of 1905 the struggle went on
unabated. The Gulf ports during this period increased their
exports of corn two and one-half times over. The struggle
was not alone confined to the carriage of grain; although export
flour being manufactured so far north, seems to have been
immune from disturbance. The trouble extended over into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>the field of packing-house products for export. It was long
thought that this could not be shipped over the roundabout
southern route, but its practicability was demonstrated at
this time. The demand of the Gulf roads for a ten per cent.
differential rate in their favor as an offset for the greater time
requisite for transit, not being accorded, rates were again cut
by one-third, sometimes being as low as twenty cents per
hundred pounds.</p>

<p>The rate wars of 1905 in the carriage of export traffic immediately
spread into the field of imports. Competition for
transcontinental and far western business has always been keen
by the Gulf routes. The notable Import Rate case already discussed,
offers a good illustration of this fact. The great volume
of tonnage moving outward through Galveston and New Orleans
necessitated a correspondingly heavy northern and northwestern
movement of empty cars. Hence the railroads leading
from the Gulf ports, actively bid both against one another and
in connection with the steamship lines against the trunk lines.
Competition was particularly keen for the carriage of the large
volume of sugar to the Middle West, particularly Missouri river
points like St. Louis and Omaha. Carriers from every point
of the compass were interested in this traffic. The trunk lines
brought refined sugar from the seaboard cities where the West
Indian product is concentrated. The Gulf lines brought the
Louisiana product, partly as a back-load against exported grain.
And the transcontinental lines brought the Hawaiian sugar, also
as a back-load against a predominance of westbound tonnage.
All hands thus directly took part.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> For three years this sugar
war persisted despite all attempts at harmony. Rates were
constantly cut by fifty per cent., always of course to the profit
of the large sugar refiners. Coffee, also constituting an important
part of our import trade, and of course particularly adapted
to entry through the Gulf ports, was carried at ruinous rates.
Thus on green coffee during 1905, the rate from New Orleans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>to St. Paul was cut from forty to fifteen cents per hundred
pounds, while coincidently the rate on sugar dropped from
thirty-two to ten cents. The struggle for import business extended
finally to all imports of merchandise from Europe. The
Illinois Central, for example, actively bid for the imported plate
glass business about this time. At a meeting of parties concerned
in 1905, the fact developed that every one of the important
lines had entered into contracts for the carriage of this
traffic at rates approximately one-half those normally prevalent.
The trunk lines of course had to meet this competition or lose
the business. The Pennsylvania Railroad cut the rate on
crockery from forty to eighteen cents; on imported seeds the
rate dropped from fifty to twenty cents and on toys from
seventy-five to twenty-five cents per hundred pounds. These
rate wars it will be observed differed neither in extent nor degree
from those of a generation earlier. One cannot avoid the conclusion
that the utter demoralization of rates was ended only
by the intervention of the Federal government; first by the
sturdy and determined application of the Elkins Law under
President Roosevelt's personal direction, and later by extension
of the principle of supervision and regulation by the Hepburn
Act of 1906.</p>

<p>The principal breach since the sugar wars was a rather persistent
and locally interesting disturbance of westbound import
rates, precipitated in the spring of 1909 by the Boston &amp;
Maine Railroad. Its object was to overcome the disability
against the port of Boston in the matter of imports, due to the
differentials allowed at Philadelphia and Baltimore.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> This
led to a general trunk line upset lasting about four months, in
the course of which rates from Boston to Chicago were reduced
from sixty-nine to fifty-eight cents. This obviously left little
profit in the business. Yet it was a mild concession as compared
with the struggles of earlier years. Two years later, in June,
1911, trouble threatened to break out again. This time it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>the Delaware &amp; Hudson and Erie roads which filed reduced
rates to the interior. But the solidarity of feeling between the
trunk lines was such that an open breach was prevented at the
last moment. The prompt intervention of the Federal authorities
was a noticeable feature on this occasion. It may somewhat
safely be predicated that further serious disturbance in future
is unlikely to occur.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_504_504" id="Footnote_504_504"></a><a href="#FNanchor_504_504"><span class="label">[504]</span></a> The continuation of Commons' index number of freight rates to
date, seemed inadvisable on account of the changes in traffic conditions
which have taken place. Originally well selected, the thirty-seven rates
chosen in 1900 are not now representative. There are, for instance, no
transcontinental quotations at all; none from the southern states, such as
on raw cotton; none for the great staples elsewhere moving under commodity
ratings, such as iron ore, chemical fertilizers, lumber, citrus fruit,
etc. Moreover, twelve of the thirty-seven items chosen by Commons were
rates on petroleum which now moves in bulk in pipe lines except locally.
Several of the quotations for coal, and for all the other carload rates, as a
matter of fact, have been so affected by changes in carload minimum rules,
that the mere rate by itself has little significance.
</p>
<p>
Rejecting Commons' particular index number by reason of its inherent
defects does not, however, lessen the desirability of choosing some other
combination of rates which may be used as a standard for measurement
of rate changes year by year. Yet the selection of such an index number is
open to all the difficulties attaching to a similar index number of prices.
Is the object, for example, an academic determination of rate changes
<i>per se</i>; or is it intended to ascertain the financial burden of such charges
upon the community? In the former case the volume of traffic affected
would not be an important consideration. Local rates on indigo or millinery
would be given the same weight as similar changes in the rate on
wheat between Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard. The latter mode of
approaching the question, on the other hand, would correspond to an index
number of prices, weighted according to the volume of consumption. A
doubled freight rate on hard coal to Perth Amboy would outweigh an equal
change in the charge on castile soap in exact proportion to its commercial
importance as measured by the total tonnage transported. Many such
details would call for careful consideration before the final adoption of the
rate items chosen to constitute the index number; but the Interstate Commerce
Commission might well consider the initiation of such a statistical
project, endeavoring to do for railroad rates what the Federal Commissioner
of Labor performs so satisfactorily in officially recording current
changes in the price of commodities. Such a record of railroad rates
extending over a series of years, supplemented by data for ton mileage
revenue, would be invaluable in the determination of the reasonableness
of rate advances in future; even as the rate increases of 1910 clearly
pointed to the need of a similar standard for purposes of comparison from
year to year in the past.</p></div>

<p>Due appreciation of the significance of the great body of
Federal legislation concerning railroads which has accumulated
during the last quarter century in the United States, depends
upon a clear understanding of the economic events of the period.
Great laws are not the figments of men's minds, conjured up in
a day. They are a response to the needs of the time. Their
true causes are thus immeasurably complex. Nor does a wholesale
public demand for legislation arise overnight. From
small beginnings the pressure steadily grows, oftentimes for
years; until, perhaps through a conjuncture of particularly
aggravating events, matters are at last brought suddenly to a
head. Yet while this culmination of industrial or social pressure
may finally result in legislation under some particularly
strong political leadership, to assign such personal influence
as even the remote cause of legislation, is to belie all the facts
and experience of history. No clearer illustration of the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
relationship between economic causes and statutory results
could perhaps be found, than in the field of our Federal legislation
concerning common carriers. It forms one of the most
important chapters in our industrial history.</p>

<p>Several of the economic causes of the Act to Regulate Commerce
of 1887, are deep-rooted in the preceding decade. A few
even run back to Civil War times. Foremost among these was
the rapid expansion of the railway net; and particularly, as
outlined in our introductory historical chapter, its phenomenal
growth during the eighties. More new mileage was laid down
in the year of the Act itself than at any other time in our entire
history within a single twelvemonth. Of equal significance,
however, was the far more than commensurate development of
long distance, that is to say, interstate business. The through
carriage of livestock and grain to the seaboard for export
attained immense importance; and the settlement of the
Middle West called for a corresponding westward movement of
manufactured goods. The Windom Committee of 1874 on
"Transportation Routes to the Seaboard"<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> bears eloquent
testimony to the growing importance of this through traffic
as a factor in legislative activity. According to the Cullom
Committee Report twelve years later,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> approximately three-fourths
of the railway traffic of the country was already at that
time interstate in character. On the trunk lines, excepting
the Pennsylvania Railroad which still relied more largely on
Pittsburg-Philadelphia tonnage, more nearly nine-tenths of the
traffic consisted of through, as distinct from local, business.
Obviously, this pointed to the assumption of authority by the
Federal government, if any were to be exercised; inasmuch
as the separate states, as will shortly appear, were held by the
Supreme Court of the United States in 1886 to be powerless to
deal with interstate commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The growing disposition of Congress to assume control over
interstate business had already been evinced in the passage of
two Federal statutes. One in 1872 had dealt with abuses in
the carriage of livestock. And another, even earlier, had sought
to remove obstacles set up by local jealousy and monopoly to
the through carriage of goods. Some railway charters actually
prohibited railroads from making connections with other
lines; or from allowing cars to leave their own rails. The
Erie, for example, was thus hampered; lest the trade of southern
New York be diverted to rival seaports. But the military
necessity of through transport of troops, and the impediments
to speedy and cheap carriage of mails and goods through delays
at junction points, impelled Congress to authorize, though not
as yet to compel, the formation of through routes and the issue
of through bills of lading by the Act of 1866. The immediate
response to this permissive legislation was the rise of the private
car lines, elsewhere described, in connection with personal
discrimination and also in the general historical review.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>No widespread demand for a general reduction of railroad
rates seems to have existed in 1887. In this regard the situation
is strikingly in contrast with that which prevailed during
the protracted hard times succeeding the panic of 1873. Acute
industrial depression during that period had aroused deep public
feeling against the "extortions of soulless railway corporations."
It was but natural that all the farmers in the newly settled
states should actively participate in the Granger movement.
The popular war cry in this agitation was lower freight rates.
This demand is voiced in the President's message of 1872,
calling for "more certain and cheaper transportation, of the
rapidly increasing western and southern products, to the Atlantic
seaboard." The proposals of the Senate to attain these
objects are contained in the above-mentioned Windom Committee
Report of 1874. Competition is to be stimulated by the
development of waterways and new trunk lines. A bureau of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
commerce is proposed. The long and short haul principle in
rate making is to be enforced. Stock-watering is to be prohibited;
and publicity of rates to be brought about. On the
whole, reduced charges are to be secured rather by means of
natural competition among carriers than through legislation.
But the keynote of the Windom Report of 1874 is cheaper
carriage of goods,&mdash;a general reduction of rates all along the
line.</p>

<p>Many things happened during the next twelve years
to modify this demand. By 1886, according to the Cullom
Committee, "the paramount evil chargeable against the operation
of the transportation systems of the United States, as
now conducted, is unjust discrimination between persons,
places, commodities, or particular descriptions of traffic."
Purely economic events had brought about this change of
opinion. The rate wars of the seventies; a revival of general
prosperity in 1879; and great mechanical improvements and
economies in operation, had brought about the desired decline
of freight rates.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> For the time the bogey of extortionate
charges was laid at rest. The Act of 1887, elaborate as it
was in form, seems not to have been intended to deal with
rates in any general way. It was in the main aimed at
the prevention of specific abuses. "The practice of discrimination
in one form or another is the principal cause of complaint."
Consequently, the long succession of bills introduced
in the House of Representatives year after year for more than
a decade by Judge Reagan of Texas and others, made no attempt
to provide administrative machinery by which to fix rates in
general; but sought merely to prohibit these specific abuses by
statute.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> The proposition for a permanent commission to deal
with rates in a more comprehensive way, seems, as we shall see,
to have emanated from the Senate at a later time. But this
more statesman-like proposition from the upper chamber was
essentially different from the response in the House of Representatives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>to popular feeling against discriminatory practices,
which slowly gathered force during more than a decade of
agitation and debate.</p>

<p>What now were some of the specific "discriminations" which
these various bills in Congress aimed to prevent? And why did
the movement come to a head in 1887? The evidence is conclusive
that personal favoritism as between rival shippers took
first place. The indiscriminate and cut-throat competition of
the carriers, particularly in connection with the trunk line rate
wars, offered a golden opportunity to those in search of secret
and preferential rates.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> The chief offender, of course, was the
Standard Oil Company under the direction of John D. Rockefeller.
The Cassatt revelations in 1877 as to exclusive contracts
with the great trunk lines for the carriage of oil, greatly stirred
public opinion. Congressional attention had been directed to
the subject some years before by complaints from the Pennsylvania
field. But the abortive results of the investigation of
1875 demonstrated nothing beyond the shameful impudence
of the chief offenders. According to the New York (Hepburn)
Committee investigation in 1879, few shippers had ever seen
printed tariffs. The Assistant General Freight Agent of the
New York Central testified that one-half the business out of
New York, and nine-tenths out of Syracuse went on special
rates. At this time there was also unrest in the anthracite coal
trade. Moreover, the activity of the "eveners" in the cattle
business in 1875-1879<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> had laid the foundation for still other
monopolies built up by means of rebates. But the constant
irritant in the public eye was the Standard Oil Company.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> The
Lake Shore case, fought through every Ohio court and then on
appeal up to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1886,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>widely advertised the discriminatory practices of the railroads.
But the most spectacular disclosures of all took place in 1885-1888
in the George Rice cases in Ohio. The Cullom Committee
in recommending publicity of rates as its primary remedy for
the evils of the time, specifically cites "this most impudent and
outrageous" proceeding.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> In the protracted struggle in conference
committee upon the provisions of the act, elimination of
rebates was the only subject upon which both House and Senate
conferees were in thorough accord from the start. Whatever
the commercial crimes chargeable to the founder of the Standard
Oil Company, he should, at least, be credited with the performance
of a great public service in finally crystallising public
opinion in 1887 in favor of railroad legislation for the prevention
of rebating.</p>

<p>Distrust of monopoly has always loomed up large in the
public eye. The dread of it is voiced in every public document
of the time. The Windom Committee in 1874, as we have seen,
looked to the stimulation of railway competition as its chief
remedy against high rates. Five years later, the Hepburn Committee
in New York vehemently denounced railroad monopoly
as an evil to be sternly repressed. But, in the meantime, the
carriers, almost prostrated by the excesses of their rate wars,
were slowly learning how to co&ouml;perate for the maintenance of
more stable charges. Railroad pools and traffic agreements,
first essayed about 1875, were gradually elaborated; until by
1886 nearly all parts of the country were covered by them.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
From small beginnings in 1877, the Trunk Line Association
under Albert Fink was in its heyday of activity. The Southern
Railway Association was restoring order out of chaos, south of
the Ohio river. By 1886 all competitive traffic north and west
of Chicago was pooled. This was especially true of the highly
competitive business between the Missouri and Mississippi
rivers. Even in remoter regions, such agreements threatened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>to deprive the public of the benefits of rival railroad construction.
In Colorado and New Mexico public sentiment was
deeply aroused over the tripartite division of territory between
the carriers then in the field.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The helplessness of independent
railroads was made evident in connection with the attempt
of the (now) Colorado &amp; Southern road to gain a foothold.
Its suits in both state and Federal courts, and the attempted
remedial legislation by Colorado in 1885, disclosed the great
power of monopoly over the public welfare in that region. In
Texas, the Gould-Huntington apportionment of the field between
the two systems in 1881,<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> was doubtless perceived as to
its results, even if its precise terms were secret. The Texas
Traffic Association, also, organized in 1875, embraced all the
lines in that vicinity. May it not well be that the final inclusion
in the Act of 1887 of the prohibition of pooling, upon direct
insistence of the Texas representative in Congress against the
protest of the Senate, had some connection with these events?
It seems clear that the marked interest of the railways in eliminating
competition all over the country at this critical time,
carried great weight with Congress in shaping the law.</p>

<p>The years since the Civil War had witnessed an ever increasing
volume of speculation and fraud in railway affairs,
which reached its climax in the frenzied construction period of
the eighties.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Jay Gould, "Jim" Fisk and their successors who
contributed to the "railway panic" of 1884, had done their work
well in arousing public hostility to the railroads. The Hepburn
Committee Report in New York is symptomatic of the state of
feeling in its vehement denunciation of these practices.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The
Windom Committee, five years earlier, had officially registered
its opinion that of all the abuses of the time, "none have contributed
so much to the general discontent and indignation as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>the increase of railway capital by <i>stock watering</i> and <i>capitalization
of surplus earnings</i>. The murmurs of discontent have
swollen into a storm of popular indignation. Your committee
believe the evil to be of such magnitude as to justify and require
for its prevention the co&ouml;peration of both Congress and the
States."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> Nor is the Cullom Committee less emphatic in 1886;
although its condemnation is shifted from the trunk lines, particularly
the New York Central and the Erie, to the newly
constructed "unnecessary roads." "This practice (of stock
watering) has unquestionably done more to create and keep
alive a popular feeling of hostility against the railroads of the
United States than any other one cause."<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> All were agreed that
the remedy must be applied by the states, from which the companies
derived their charters. But a powerful impulse toward
publicity of accounts and operating details as well as of rates,
to be enforced by the hand of the Federal government, was
unquestionably imparted by the financial scandals of the time.
It was hoped that fraudulent construction concerns, subsidiary
companies for "milking" the main corporation, unnecessary
paralleling of existing lines for purposes of blackmail, speculative
bankruptcies and all similar practices of the period might be
restrained in part by letting in the light of day upon their affairs.</p>

<p>Then again, there were the discriminations in rates, so vehemently
denounced, against the small towns and local business,
in favor of the large cities mainly interested in long distance
traffic. Such jealousies and rivalries of course antedate the
railroad. They are almost as old as trade. And yet the course
of affairs since the panic of 1873, had lent peculiar force to them
by the middle of the eighties. It had been a period of ruinous
railroad competition all over the land, but especially in trunk
line territory. Through rates had fallen tremendously; without
any corresponding change in local charges.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The great
western cities and the remote farmers were the immediate
beneficiaries, of course. But there were the older communities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>of the East to be reckoned with,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>&mdash;the farmers of New England
and Middle New York and the secondary cities which had once
been terminal points but were now become way stations. In
the South, new towns were springing up, anxious to divide
distributive trade with the older cotton concentration points.
Nashville, soon to take first place in a celebrated case, was
being built up by a favoring railway; and Atlanta, a purely
railroad town, was in rapid growth at the expense of older rivals.
The separate states had long sought to deal with this ancient
evil of local discrimination in rates by means of long and short
haul clauses; but to little effect. What wonder that the Cullom
Committee in 1886, heads its long list of "complaints against
the railroad system of the United States" by two forms of this
alleged evil!</p>

<p>In brief, the contemporary evidence all goes to show that,&mdash;quite
aside from evil intent,&mdash;the railroad business of the
United States in the middle of the eighties, was in a highly disorganized
state. Phenomenal economic development since the
resumption of specie payments in 1879, had perhaps outstripped
the capacity of managements to scientifically order their affairs.
Collateral evidence as to this is the extraordinary wastefulness,
of operation which prevailed. Competition had run mad. All
of the tricks and vagaries of roundabout routing of freight
found place.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> To keep pace with mere operating demands was
a heavy enough task,&mdash;to say nothing of constructing well-ordered
tariffs, keeping straight accounts, and providing adequate
funds for growth. And out of this unsettled condition of
affairs there had sprung the usual mushroom crop of speculation,
fraud and corruption which is bound to flourish at such
times.</p>

<p>And then, finally, in seeking to understand the economic
situation in 1887, the intolerable arrogance of great railway
managers must be kept in mind. Honorable exceptions there
must have been, to be sure. But the "Public be damned"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>attitude of the old Commodore Vanderbilt was evidently a
general, although perhaps a somewhat exaggerated one. It is
certain that there was no well-defined sense of responsibility to
the public. All attempts at investigation or reform were
treated as "interference with private business." The rising
tide of popular feeling was increased by evidence of corrupt
political practices, as well as of mere crude contempt for the
rights of patrons. Read the congressional debates upon the
Camden and Amboy monopoly in New Jersey; the special laws
"jammed" through the state legislature by the New York
Central Railroad;<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> and the revelations as to corruption in the
Credit Mobilier and other proceedings in Congress.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Such
things added fuel to the flames in the East, kindled and kept
alive in the West by the Granger movement. The time for an
attempt to curb the second great manifestation of corporate
power in the United States was indeed at hand. The only
question was as to the form which it should assume.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The congressional history of the Act of 1887 extends over a
period of nearly fifteen years. The first general bill to pass
the House of Representatives in 1874, had for its object a
reduction of rates; but the movement for the elimination of
discriminatory practices did not begin until two years later.
Then in 1877, came the first of the long series of bills which
finally led up to the statute in its final form, prepared by
Representative Reagan of Texas. But it was not until 1884 that
the Senate, ever tardy in its response to public sentiment, began
to take the matter seriously. Its earlier interest in reduced
rates had dissipated, ten years before, with the Windom Committee
Report. Now, however, under the leadership of the
Senator from Illinois, the Cullom Committee brought in a bill,
the distinctive feature of which was provision for a permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>administrative commission. The various House bills, in their
distrust of executive appointments and authority, had favored
leaving the elimination of abuses, once clearly defined by law,
to the Federal courts. A legislative deadlock between the two
chambers resulted upon this point; as well as concerning the
status of pooling. For the House sought to prohibit all traffic
agreements; while the Senate would permit them under proper
administrative supervision.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture the Supreme Court decision in the
Wabash, St. Louis, and Pacific Railway case<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> was handed
down. It specifically denied to the individual states, power to
regulate the ever-increasing volume of interstate traffic. This
decision put the match to the long train of influences making
for action. The Senate and House bills were therefore taken
up in conference committee, with the usual outcome of give and
take. The Senate gained its point of administrative, rather
than judicial, control. A commission was provided; but the
courts were accorded power to entertain appeals. On the other
hand, the House conferees insisted upon the prohibition of
pooling and a more stringent long and short haul clause. All
were agreed in respect to the publicity features. The series of
votes at different times with steadily growing majorities,
leading up finally to the passage of this compromise statute by
both houses, is significant of the progress of public opinion upon
the matter.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of the Act to Regulate Commerce of
1887 need not long concern us.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Everything depended upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>the interpretation of the clause in the Constitution conferring
upon Congress power over commerce with foreign nations and
among the states. A generation earlier the regulation of railroads
by Federal statute might not have been sanctioned. But
Lincoln and Grant had dealt a death blow to the old states'
rights idea. And the positive legislation after the Civil War
prior to this time, had already denoted a much more progressive
and liberal point of view. The far-reaching decisions of the
Supreme Court following <i>Munn v. Illinois</i> in 1876 had clearly
upheld the power of the several states to regulate commerce.
The situation called only for definition of the dividing line between
state and Federal authority. This was accorded in the
Wabash case, which, as has already been stated, terminated the
congressional deadlock, and brought about an agreement upon
the terms of the law. Nor is it without significance, in the light
of subsequent events, that the Wabash case was an appeal by a
common carrier to Federal authority for protection against a
state statute.</p>

<p>A brief summary of the main provisions of the Act to
Regulate Commerce, at this point, will be convenient for future
reference.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Section 1. It applies to freight and passengers by land; or by
land and water in cases of continuous or through shipment, even to
foreign countries. All charges shall be reasonable and just; and every
unjust and unreasonable charge is prohibited.</p>

<p>Section 2. Rebates and personal discrimination of every sort
forbidden.</p>

<p>Section 3. Local discrimination forbidden; equal facilities for
interchange of traffic with connecting lines prescribed.</p>

<p>Section 4. Long and short haul clause: "That it shall be unlawful
for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act, to charge
or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation
of passengers or of like kind of property, under substantially
similar circumstances and conditions, for a shorter than for a longer
distance over the same line, in the same direction, the shorter being
included within the longer distance; but this shall not be construed
as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this act to
charge and receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
distance: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That upon application to the Commission
appointed under the provisions of this act, such common carrier may,
in special cases, after investigation by the Commission, be authorized
to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation
of passengers or property; and the Commission may from time
to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier
may be relieved from the operation of this section of this act."</p>

<p>Section 5. All pooling and traffic agreements prohibited.</p>

<p>Section 6. All rates and fares to be printed and posted for public
inspection at all stations; and filed with the Commission at Washington.
No advance in rates except after ten days notice. All charges,
other than as published, forbidden.</p>

<p>Section 9. Procedure by complaint before the Commission or
Federal courts. Power to compel testimony and production of
papers.</p>

<p>Section 10. Penalty of $5000 for each offence in violation.
(Amended in 1889, adding imprisonment.)</p>

<p>Section 11. Interstate Commerce Commission of five members
established; by Presidential appointment; term six years.</p>

<p>Section 12. Powers of Commission to inquire, with right to obtain
full information necessary to exercise of its authority. Power over
witnesses and production of papers, to be sustained by U. S. Circuit
Courts.</p>

<p>Sections 13-14. Procedure before Commission by complaint.
Parties competent to appear. Decisions to include findings of fact
upon which based, for courts on appeal.</p>

<p>Section 15. Duty of Commission to notify carriers to "cease and
desist" from violation, or to make reparation for injury done.</p>

<p>Section 16. To enforce obedience, procedure by petition of
Commission in Federal courts, which may issue writs.</p>

<p>Section 20. Annual detailed reports from carriers as to finance,
operation, rates or regulations in prescribed forms as desired by the
Commission.</p></div>

<p>Such is the substance of the statute which marks the real,
beginning of subjection of the railroads to control by the Federal
government. It was avowedly tentative in character. It was
a compromise, entirely satisfactory to no one. Many of its
provisions were not new. Administrative commissions had
already been in existence some time in several of the states.
Pooling had also commonly been condemned. The long and
short haul clause in the statute constitutes no innovation. It
was based specifically upon a number of state laws, more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
similar to it in tenor.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> In Vermont, for example, since 1850;
in Virginia, since 1867; and in Massachusetts, since 1874,
long and short haul clauses had been in force. Some seventeen
states, prior to the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act
in 1887, had conceded the wisdom of such an adjustment between
local and long hauls. Nor were such statutes disregarded,
as a rule. Thus, in Massachusetts they were enforced to the
extreme degree of prohibiting any concession in rates at Provincetown,
on the point of Cape Cod, one hundred and twenty
miles from Boston by land, while only thirty-six miles in a
direct line by water, below the rates at any of the intermediate
points on the roundabout rail line along the Cape. The debates
in Congress at the time this section of the Act was under
discussion show that the bill as finally passed was a compromise
between an absolutely inflexible prohibition, in the House,
and a more elastic measure, providing for exceptions, in the
Senate.</p>

<p>In one respect the law of 1887 marks a profound revolution
in both commercial theory and practice. Its provisions concerning
equality of rates to all classes of shippers denote a great
moral uplift in the business standards of the country. Prior
to this time the English common law, while requiring reasonableness
of charges by common carriers, by no means insured
that such charges should be stable and uniform. This flowed
perhaps from the circumstance that rebating was an essentially
American abuse. Neither in England, nor on the continent
for that matter, had business rivals ever made such use of the
services of carriers to suppress fair competition in trade. With
us, on the other hand, in the early free-and-easy days, entire
freedom of contract between shipper and carrier had been the
rule. Published tariffs were only the starting point for "higgle"
and "dicker." It was not bad form for a shipper to "go
shopping" freely among the freight agents of competing lines.
The location of new enterprises, new opportunities for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
expansion of old ones, were all more or less conditioned by the
special favors which were so readily obtainable on demand.
Nor was the accompaniment of secrecy necessarily due to fear
of moral condemnation by the community. Secrecy was an
economic essential of the device, as has elsewhere been shown.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
By this new statute all was suddenly changed. Rebating was
made a crime, punishable as such. Is it any wonder that,
almost from the outset and for nearly fifteen years, this part of
the law was the storm centre of litigation; and that in respect
of rebating, the need of supplementary legislation should
first become apparent?</p>

<p>The first response to the new Federal law by the railroads
was entirely favorable.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> They sought to obey its mandates
both in letter and spirit. The Commission reports in 1888
that the railroads "conformed promptly" to their orders;
although in the South and West they were "moving more
slowly." On the other hand, the new Commission under the
leadership of Judge Cooley, an able jurist trusted by all parties
concerned, was equally conciliatory in spirit. Many desirable
changes were brought about in railway practice. Attempts
were made to remodel tariffs all over the country, particularly
in the East, to conform to the long and short haul clause.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>The immediate effect of acquiescence in Section 4 was to
compel, in many parts of the country, a reduction of the local
rates in order to reduce them below the rates charged to terminal
and competitive points. Thus, for example, throughout trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>line territory, they were almost uniformly adjusted to meet
this requirement. Even in the southern states, where in some
quarters the most persistent opposition to the law has from the
first existed, there was a patent disposition shown to recognize
the justice of such legislation. The Southern Railroad modified
its tariff all along the line as far as Atlanta, although it claimed
inability to make changes beyond that point. For nearly
three years, in fact, the carriers conformed in an increasing
degree to this requirement of the law.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> A sincere effort toward
uniform classification of freight, with substantial results in the
direction of simplification of schedules, extended over several
years. Many pools were disbanded; all were reorganized in
conformity with the statute. And in the matter of uniformity
and publicity of statistical returns, friendly co&ouml;peration
between the railroads and the Commission, brought about great
improvements in accounting practice. No considerable popular
interest in the new commercial tribunal, to be sure, is indicated
by the volume of its business. After five years experience,
only thirty-nine formal complaints were filed in 1892. But
this may have been due in part to the natural hesitancy of shippers
to antagonizing the roads by coming out into the open with
their grievances. Or, perhaps, it was merely because the
people at large were as yet quite unfamiliar with the law and
with the ease of procedure under it.</p>

<p>The earliest intimation of determined resistance by the
carriers came in connection with prosecutions for rebating in
1890. This abuse was still widely prevalent. The Commission
complained in that year of the "general disregard" of
the law against personal discrimination; and set out to prosecute
with vigor. But witnesses called upon to testify before
grand juries as to such practices, proved recalcitrant.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Corporations
could be made amenable to the law only through the
instrumentality of persons in their employ. And guilt in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>matters could be detected only by the testimony of those who
had directly witnessed, or participated in, the unlawful acts
themselves. As one writer has put it, "Rebate contracts are
not usually negotiated before large audiences nor are rebate
payments commonly made upon street corners. An essential
element in these practices, quite aside from their legality, is the
secrecy with which they are conducted." It soon became
apparent that unless this mantle of secrecy could be stripped off
in preliminary proceedings, not even indictments could be had,&mdash;to
say nothing of the proof needed for subsequent conviction.</p>

<p>The first ground for contesting the right of the government
to extort testimony from unwilling witnesses arose, oddly
enough, from an amendment of the law intended to increase its
effectiveness. Originally punishable only by heavy fine, on
recommendation of the Commission, Congress added in 1889 an
amendment whereby departure from the published rate was
made punishable also by imprisonment. By this change
criminal, as well as civil, procedure was thus brought into play.
The amendment, moreover, extended the punishment to shippers;
the railroad official who gave rebates having alone been
liable hitherto. An unexpected result speedily followed. In
1890 one Counselman, a shipper, questioned concerning his
enjoyment of less than the open rate upon grain, declined to
answer, taking refuge under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States. This declared that "no
person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself." The witness persisted in his refusal
to testify even before a district judge: and the case went on
appeal through the Circuit Court which decided in favor of
the Commission, up to the Supreme Court of the United States.
This tribunal in 1892 held that the Revised Statutes of the
United States which for twenty-five years had been held to
protect the constitutional rights of witnesses when called upon
to give testimony, against criminal proceedings based upon
such evidence, did not in fact adequately afford such protec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>tion.
Counselman was ordered discharged from the custody
of the United States Marshal. It was held, furthermore,
"that a statutory enactment to be valid, must afford absolute
immunity for the offence to which the question relates."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
Congress promptly passed a law to this effect in the following
year. The matter did not, however, rest here. The validity
of this later statute had now to be upheld. And, with
discouraging defeat in 1894 in an Illinois Circuit Court, the
issue had to be raised again a year later elsewhere, to be then
carried on appeal a second time to the Supreme Court. This
took place in the so-called Brown case.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The final outcome in
1896 was a complete denial of the right of witnesses to withhold
material testimony. But it required six years of litigation
to bring about the desired result.</p>

<p>During the pendency of the proceedings above described,
a second line of resistance to the government developed. Not
the merely negative personal right of witnesses to withhold
testimony, but the positive legal authority of the Commission
to exact it, was called in question. This struck at the very
roots of all procedure. For it challenged the validity of the
Act itself. In how far might an administrative body, independently,
have power, hitherto resident alone in the courts and
Congress, to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses
as well as the production of papers? Section 12 of the Act was
evidently intended to confer such powers as were possessed
and might be delegated by the Congress. But then there was
the Constitution again to be considered! Certain witnesses
declined to produce books and answer questions in 1892. One
Brimson was selected for a test case. The first decision by the
Circuit Court held these sections of the statute to be unconstitutional
on the ground that "Congress cannot make the
judicial department the mere adjunct or instrument of the
other departments." But the Supreme Court of the United
States in 1894 reversed this judgment; and, unreservedly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>although by a bare majority opinion, affirmed the constitutionality
of the procedure under the Act.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> This Brimson
opinion, together with the Brown decision two years later,
were confidently believed to have so strengthened the arm of
the government that rebating might at last be eliminated.
But, as will shortly appear, an entirely new law was yet
needed to eradicate the evil. For the moment, however, the
right of Congress to legislate and of the Commission to act,
had been upheld.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The relation of the Interstate Commerce Commission as an
administrative body to the Federal courts under the provisions
of the Act of 1887, proved unsatisfactory from the first. In
order to understand the situation, it may be well to review
the ordinary procedure. Formal complaint having been filed, the
Commission heard the case and promulgated its decision in the
form of an order to the carriers. If they chose to comply with
it, well and good. Otherwise, the Commission must apply to a
Federal court for the issuance of a judicial writ to compel
obedience to the order. Thereupon the court proceeded to
review the case; and upon the findings to issue an order of its
own. From this order, however, appeal might be taken even
up to the Supreme Court. Then, and then only, did the original
mandate of the Commission have the force of law. Practically,
two results followed, as shown by the experience of the succeeding
years. There was intolerable delay in the redress of grievances;
and, in the second place, all definitive proceedings were
postponed until the case had gone on appeal to the courts.
In other words the Commission instead of being a co&ouml;rdinate
body with the courts, was reduced to an entirely subordinate
position. Its function became merely to institute proceedings,
and thereafter to appear as a complainant before other tribunals
competent alone to decide the case. Intolerable delay in
procedure was the constant complaint of shippers. Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
elapsed before final judgments were rendered. The average
duration of cases appealed was not less than four years. Sometimes
they extended over twice that period. Often, as in the
Charleston, S. C., case in 1898, several years elapsed before
the Commission itself rendered a decision. Knotty cases were
sidetracked.</p>

<p>But the main source of delay was in the carriage of cases on
appeal up to the Supreme Court of the United States. They
had to await their turn in regular order, being given no priority
on the crowded dockets. The Social Circle and Import Rate
cases, soon to be discussed, consumed five years in litigation,
even after the Commission had rendered its opinion. The
Florida Fruit Exchange case involving rates on oranges, originally
decided by the Commission in 1891, was for six years
thereafter before the Federal Courts. The Georgia Railroad
Commission cases were not settled for nine years. Nor did
the tedious process end here. After the judicial review, which
usually covered the law points, the entire question had to be
remanded to the Commission for a new order in conformity
with the findings of the court. After nine years of litigation
in the Chattanooga case, back it went to the Commission to be
re-tried after consideration of other commercial factors. First
decided in 1892, it was reopened in 1904.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Is it any wonder that
the number of formal proceedings instituted on complaint of shippers
steadily dwindled year by year? In 1901 only nineteen petitions
were filed. Business of this sort was almost at a standstill.</p>

<p>A second unsatisfactory feature of the relations of the
Commission to the courts, lay in the refusal of the latter to
accept the evidence taken before the Commission in the original
proceedings as final. Trouble began in 1888 on the first appeal,
known as the Kentucky and Indiana Bridge case.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>treated it as an original proceeding, even as to questions of
fact; and proceeded to consider it <i>de novo</i>. This of course
involved a duplication of all expenses; which, in causes sufficiently
important to appeal, were very heavy. Ten volumes of
typewritten testimony, each as large as the Congressional
Record, were taken, for instance, in the San Bernardino case.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
Both shipper and railroad, therefore, commonly came to regard
the proceedings before the Commission as merely a necessary
formality to be observed prior to the conclusive adjudication of
the matter by the courts. This placed the Commission in a
most awkward predicament. It was compelled by law to
render a decision upon an entirely imperfect presentation of
facts. And this decision was thereafter liable to be reviewed
upon the basis of entirely new testimony. Thus in the leading
Alabama Midland case, involving the reasonableness of rates
to Troy, Alabama, as compared with adjacent towns, much
depended upon the existence of effective competition with the
railroads from boat lines on the rivers at other places.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Before
the Commission the evidence adduced by the carriers
dwelt upon the navigability of the Chattahoochee river as compelling
lower rates at Columbus and Eufaula than at Troy, an
inland town. Yet, when the case was really opened up in
appeal proceedings, it appeared that this magnificent waterway
was really dry about half the year; that the channel was never
deeper than three feet; and that boats were at all times of the
year "embarrassed by the overhanging trees." How could
the Commission be expected to pass upon vital questions wisely
under such circumstances? Whether wilfully done or not,&mdash;and
evidence is not lacking of a deliberate policy adopted in
some cases,&mdash;the inevitable effect was to bring the Commission
and the law itself into discredit. So accentuated did this evil
become, that in the Social Circle case the Supreme Court distinctly
discountenanced the practice, declaring it to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>intention of the law that all material facts should be disclosed
in the original proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> But it was not until 1906 that
the mode of procedure on appeal was by statute clearly defined.
In the meantime public interest in the work of the Commission
was bound to wane.</p>

<p>In this connection it may not be out of place to refer to the
persistent use made of the record of the Commission in court
proceedings under these adverse circumstances, as a plausible
argument by the railroads in later years against any augmentation
of its powers. One brief, for example, recites that "since
1887, forty-three suits have been instituted to enforce final
orders of the Commission as to rates. The net result of the
action of the courts shows two affirmances and thirty reversals."
It continues later, "as over ninety per cent. of the Commission's
orders as to rates which have gone before the courts have been
overruled, it is impossible to foretell what havoc would follow
from the exercise of such powers." This statement is entirely
true, but it is not the entire truth. We may profitably consider
the cases of sufficient importance to have been passed upon by
the Supreme Court of the United States. Between 1887 and
1905, sixteen such decisions were rendered on cases appealed
for enforcement by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Fifteen of these were decided in favor of the carriers, while only
one sustained in part the contention of the Commission. At
first sight, this record certainly appears to warrant the condemnation
of the Commission. A body so persistently on the
wrong side of great questions as this record indicates, would
surely invite distrust. There were two answers to this contention,
however, which merit consideration before a final judgment
can be rendered. One of these was the irregularity of procedure,
above described. The other was that these court cases had
nearly all involved, not so much the administrative application
of the law to economic abuses, as the purely judicial interpretation
of the law itself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>
<p>Only by means of concrete cases decided by the Commission
as an administrative body, could the scope and meaning of the
original law be determined. This was a most difficult task
hinging upon the utmost legal technicalities and refinements.
Even the most learned judges failed to agree among themselves.
Thus in eight of the sixteen cases above mentioned, the decisions
in the lower Federal courts failed of agreement with the final
decree of the Supreme Court. In the Cartage case,&mdash;involving
the legality of a railway giving one shipper free cartage of goods
to a railway station as an inducement to ship over its line,
while withholding the privilege from another,&mdash;the Commission
was sustained in the Circuit Court and reversed in the two higher
tribunals. In other instances, like the Social Circle case,&mdash;turning
upon the discrimination in freight rates against small
towns in favor of large competitive centres,&mdash;the first court
ruled adversely, while the Circuit Court of Appeals and the
Supreme Court sustained the Commission in part. Or yet
again, as in the Chattanooga case,&mdash;wherein this city complained
against a higher freight rate from New York than the
rival city of Nashville enjoyed, although the goods for Nashville
passed through Chattanooga and were hauled one hundred
and fifty-one miles further,&mdash;both lower tribunals sustained
the Commission only to be finally overruled by the Supreme
Court. The fact that in only eight of these most important
cases the courts could agree among themselves indicates the
nicety of the legal issues comprehended. All parties were in
fact working much in the dark, both as to the intention of the
original law and as to the possible effects of its interpretation.
The charge of incompetence, if it held good for the Commission,
applied equally well to a large number of the most learned
judges in the Federal courts.</p>

<p>Another indication of the extreme delicacy of the legal issues
involved, is found in the lack of unanimity even among the
justices of the Supreme Court itself. In nine of the sixteen
Supreme Court cases the final decision was not rendered without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
dissent. As the lower courts were divided among themselves,
so the justices of the Supreme Court were apparently somewhat
at sea. The minority, to be sure, was small, in most cases being
due to the failure of Justice Harlan to concur. But in the far-reaching
Import Rates case,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> the court was more evenly divided.
The issue raised, concerned the legality of lower through rates
on imports from Liverpool to San Francisco <i>via</i> New Orleans,
than were granted on domestic shipments from New Orleans to
the same destination. Thus the rate on books, buttons, and
hosiery, from Liverpool to San Francisco through New Orleans
was $1.07 per hundred pounds. At the same time the domestic
shipper was compelled to pay $2.88, or two and one-half times
as much, for a haul from New Orleans to San Francisco alone.
In another important instance, tin plate was carried from Liverpool
by steamer and rail through Philadelphia to Chicago for
twenty-four cents per hundred pounds. For the American
merchant in Philadelphia the rate to the same market was
twenty-six cents. For the inland haul alone the Pennsylvania
Railroad was receiving sixteen cents on the foreign goods, while
coincidently charging American merchants ten cents more for
the same service. Discrimination against the American merchant
in favor of foreign competition, not infrequently more
than sufficient to overbalance any supposed protection afforded
by the tariff, has been repeatedly proved in such cases as this.
The duty on imported cement was eight cents per hundredweight.
In one instance, this duty with the total freight rate
added amounted to only eighteen cents, as against a rate of
twenty cents for the domestic producer from New York to the
same point. There were reasons for this grievous discrimination
against the domestic shipper, mainly concerned with the
vagaries of ocean freight rates. Steamers must have ballast
for the return trip to equalize out-going shipments of grain and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>other exports, and they will carry heavy commodities, such as
salt, cement, crockery, and glass, at extremely low rates.
Nevertheless, such imported commodities can be sold to advantage
in competition with domestic goods only when the railways
will contribute equally low rates to complete the shipment.</p>

<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission in these Import
Rate cases originally held that such discriminations were unlawful.
Two appellate courts, in turn, sustained this view.
Finally, however, the Supreme Court decided, with three members,
including the Chief Justice, dissenting, that the Interstate
Commerce Law as phrased did not expressly prohibit the
practice. Everything turned upon the interpretation of certain
clauses in the law. No question was ever raised as to the
economic issues involved, nor was it competent to these tribunals
to pass upon such issues. The question was simply and
solely this: When the Act to Regulate Commerce forbade inequality
or discrimination between shippers, did it contemplate
competition between shipments originating within the country
and others from foreign ports? Was the Interstate Commerce
Commission, in other words, empowered, in interpreting this
act, to consider circumstances and conditions <i>without</i> as well as
<i>within</i> the boundaries of the United States? If it was entitled
to consider solely domestic conditions, it was certainly right and
economically sound in forbidding such practices; if, on the
other hand, it was required to take account of commercial conditions
the world over, irrespective of the effect upon the
domestic producer and internal trade, its decision should have
been favorable to the railroads. To appreciate fully the extreme
nicety of the legal points involved and the delicacy of
the economic interests at issue, one must needs read the extended
opinions both of the majority of the Supreme Court
and of the three dissenting justices, including Chief Justice
Fuller. But to interpret the reversal of the original decision of
the Interstate Commerce Commission by this tribunal as in
the slightest degree involving incompetence or judicial unfair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>ness
is a misrepresentation of all the facts involved. As in
the preceding cases touching the interpretation of the long
and short haul clause, it may fairly be said that the consensus
of opinion among business men, and certainly among the professional
economists of the country, was on the side of the Commission
in condemning such practices. As to the law, that was
decided otherwise by a narrow majority.</p>

<p>The final breakdown of the law of 1887 came, however, not
from mere defects in procedure, but from the adverse construction
placed by the Supreme Court of the United States upon its
fundamental clauses, viz., those concerning the exercise of
rate-making power by the Commission. Whether or not it
was the intention of Congress to delegate such power, seems
not to have been considered for some years. At all events,
within two months after the law was passed the Commission
certainly interpreted the law as giving it, not only power to
investigate but to prescribe remedies for what it conceived to
be unreasonable charges. The right to exercise general rate-making
power in first instance was distinctly disclaimed.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
But the right to prescribe a modification of existing rates on
complaint was repeatedly affirmed, without question either by
the carriers or the Federal courts.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The first order of the commission
in <i>Evans vs. The Oregon Navigation Company</i> directed
a reduction of the rate on wheat from Walla Walla, Washington,
to Portland, Ore., from thirty to twenty-three and
one-half cents. It was promptly complied with. Then came
the Farmington-Red Wing, Minn., wheat case, touching not
absolute but relative rates between two competing places.
The order that the charge to one town should not exceed that to
the other by more than one-third was likewise obeyed. Even
freight classification, not specifically mentioned in the Act,
was supposed to be fully subject to the Commission's control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Reynolds case, railroad ties and lumber were ordered to
be grouped together, without contest. The activity of the
Commission at this time in promoting uniform classification
elsewhere discussed,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> was evidently based upon a similar belief
in its legal competency to act. For nearly a decade attention
seems to have been so concentrated upon matters of judicial
procedure, that this more fundamental proposition was neglected.
Moreover, all this time was needed to secure a final
pronouncement from the Supreme Court, which was alone
competent to settle it as a matter of law.</p>

<p>It was not, then, until almost ten years after the institution
of the Commission, in fact, that its rate-making power was denied.
The first shadow of doubt seems to have been expressed
in the decision of the Supreme Court in the so-called Social
Circle case.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> This involved the reasonableness of rates from
Cincinnati to the town of Social Circle, Georgia, as related to
the rates to Atlanta and Augusta on either side. Disregarding
other phases of the case which concerned the interpretation of
the long and short haul clause, the Commission had, when the
case was first decided in 1891, ordered a reduction of the rate
from Cincinnati to Atlanta from $1.09 to $1 per hundred
pounds. This case was carried to the Supreme Court, where
decision was finally rendered in 1896. Purely as an <i>obiter
dictum</i> the court discussed briefly the interpretation of the
original act in respect to rate-making power. It expressed a
reasonable doubt in the premises, even going further and confessing
inability to find any provision of the act "that expressly
or by necessary implication confers such powers." It does not
seem clear whether by this statement the court had reference
to the arbitrary prescription of rates in first instance to the
carriers, or merely to action of the Commission in prescribing
rates after complaint, in order to redress grievances.</p>

<p>Several decisions of circuit courts during 1896 re&euml;nforced
the judicial doubt as to the validity of the rate-making power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>of the Commission. Thus, for example, in the case of Coxe
Brothers,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> involving rates upon anthracite coal, which, by the
way, had been pending since 1891, the Circuit Court of Appeals
expressly declined to enforce an order of the Commission, stating
that it "is not clothed with the power to fix rates which
it undertook to exercise in this case." The court's reasoning
in the Social Circle case was followed and expressly cited.
During the same year, 1896, other cases, such as that of the
Truck Farmers' Association, were decided in the same spirit.
The final adjudication of this point, however, was reserved for
the decision in the so-called Cincinnati Freight Bureau case.
This had its origin in an application from the Commission to
enforce an order issued in 1894 against the Cincinnati, New
Orleans and Texas Pacific Railroad Company.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> The case
involved the adjustment of rates from eastern and western
centres, respectively, into the southern states; and the Commission
had decided that a reduction of the rates from the
western cities was reasonable and necessary. This leading
case, also known as the Maximum Freight Rate decision of
1897, is characterized by the Commission itself as perhaps "the
most important since the enactment of the Act to Regulate
Commerce." It merits consideration in some detail.</p>

<p>The reasoning in the Maximum Freight Rate case<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> cannot
be better put than by the following excerpts from the opinion
of the Supreme Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is one thing to inquire whether the rates which have been
charged and collected are reasonable,&mdash;that is a judicial act; but an
entirely different thing to prescribe rates which shall be charged in the
future,&mdash;that is a legislative act.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have, therefore, these considerations presented: First. The
power to prescribe a tariff of rates for carriage by a common carrier is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>legislative, and not an administrative or judicial, function, and, having
respect to the large amount of property invested in railroads, the
various companies engaged therein, the thousands of miles of road,
and the millions of tons of freight carried, the varying and diverse
conditions attaching to such carriage, is a power of supreme delicacy
and importance. Second. That Congress has transferred such a
power to any administrative body is not to be presumed or implied
from any doubtful and uncertain language. The words and phrases
efficacious to make such a delegation of power are well understood, and
have been frequently used, and, if Congress has intended to grant such
a power to the Interstate Commerce Commission, it cannot be doubted
that it would have used language open to no misconstruction, but
clear and direct. Third. Incorporating into a statute the common-law
obligation resting upon the carrier to make all its charges reasonable
and just, and directing the commission to execute and enforce the provisions
of the act, does not by implication carry to the commission, or
invest it with the power to exercise, the legislative function of prescribing
rates which shall control in the future. Fourth. Beyond the
inference which irresistibly follows from the omission to grant in express
terms to the commission this power of fixing rates is the clear language
of section 6, recognizing the right of the carrier to establish rates, to
increase or reduce them, and prescribing the conditions upon which
such increase or reduction may be made, and requiring, as the only
conditions of its action&mdash;First, publication; and, Second, the filing
of the tariff with the commission. The grant to the commission of
the power to prescribe the form of the schedules, and to direct the
place and manner of publication of joint rates, thus specifying the
scope and limit of its functions in this respect, strengthens the conclusion
that the power to prescribe rates or fix any tariff for the future
is not among the powers granted to the commission.</p>

<p>"These considerations convince us that under the interstate commerce
act the commission has no power to prescribe the tariff of rates
which shall control in the future, and therefore cannot invoke a judgment
in mandamus from the courts to enforce any such tariff by it
prescribed."</p></div>

<p>The immediate effect of this decision was to put an end to
any enforcement of decisions relative to rates by the Commission.
The carriers immediately refused to obey any orders
which the Commission issued for the redress of grievances.
This policy was manifested with increasing clearness during the
five years subsequent to the decision. It became more and
more certain that the denial of the right, not only to pass upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
the reasonableness of a particular rate, but to prescribe what
rate should supersede it, meant the abolition of all control
whatever over the scale of charges. The entire inadequacy of
making rate regulation dependent upon the mere determination
of rates as applied <i>in the past</i>, without reference to the rates
which should prevail <i>in the future</i>, was apparent on all sides.
More than this, all remedy for the parties who had borne the
burden of an unreasonable rate would seem to have been removed.
This was clearly described in the report of the Commission
for 1897. It was illustrated by the rates upon oranges.
In 1890 there had been a sudden advance on rates from Florida
to New York from thirty to forty cents. The Commission
after investigation ordered that the rate be reduced to thirty-five
cents. As a matter of fact, how could this action redress
grievances of those who had already paid forty cents per box?
It was difficult in the first place to discover who bore the burden
of the unreasonable charge; and in the second place it was
certain that some of those who suffered could not legally sue in
court. The actual shipper who alone could sue for repayment
of unreasonable charges was a middleman who recouped himself
in any event, either from the grower, the consumer, or both.
He lost nothing by reason of the unreasonable rate. As a
matter of fact, not any single individual but the locality, had
been mulcted by five cents per hundred pounds, supposing that
a rate of forty cents were unreasonable. Experience showed
that almost no shippers or other parties injured, actually attempted
to secure the restitution of moneys already paid for
unreasonable charges. In only five out of 225 cases down to
1897 was a refund actually sought; and in those cases $100 was
the maximum sought to be recovered. As a matter of fact the
damage inflicted by the existence of such an unreasonable rate
could not be measured by hundreds or perhaps by hundreds of
thousands of dollars. The bearing of this citation is to show
that any effectual protection to the shipper must proceed from
adjudication of the reasonableness of rates <i>before</i>, and not <i>after</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
they have been paid; that is to say, in advance of their exaction
by the carrier. Power to pass upon the reasonableness of
such rates prior to their enforcement, as a consequence, constitutes
practically the only safeguard which the shipping public
may enjoy. It will be observed that in this discussion reference
is made simply and solely to that class of cases where
complaint is made against the unreasonableness of a rate <i>per
se</i> as applied to all shippers alike, entirely distinct from the
exercise of powers by the Commission in respect of unreasonable
discrimination as between two or more persons or places.
That other question of relative rates was to come up in another
connection.</p>

<p>Despite this denial by the Maximum Freight Rate decision
of power to prescribe future rates, in substitution for others held
to be unreasonable, there were still certain things which the
Commission might do in the matter of rate determination.
The only question was as to whether they afforded an adequate
remedy for the redress of grievances. Were they really worth
while? Complaint as to a rate, once paid, might still be made.
The Commission might still hold it unreasonable; and even
pass upon the degree of its unreasonableness. And the complainant
shipper might then institute proceedings for repayment
of the excessive charges under that particular rate. But
the difference between this range of powers and those which had
been claimed by the Commission for ten years was simply this:
That under the original interpretation of the law the Commission
had not only decided whether rates were wrong; it had
also prescribed a remedy by issuing an order as to what rates
were right, believing that these would be enforced by the courts.
Not even the power to prescribe maximum rates remained to
the Commission after this interpretation. The only action
open to it would be to declare one rate after another unreasonable
until the carriers had been brought to terms. Its inadequacy
as a practical remedy was the main factor in bringing
about the passage of the new law of 1906.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>It must not be assumed that the Supreme Court in the
Maximum Freight Rate decision intended to render the Commission
an entirely superfluous body. But its functions, as set
forth in the following quotation from the opinion, proclaimed
the adoption of an entirely different policy concerning public
control of rates from the one hitherto pursued. Whether it
was adequate for the purpose in view will appear, as has just
been observed, from the subsequent course of events.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"But has the commission no functions to perform in respect to the
matter of rates, no power to make any inquiry in respect thereto?
Unquestionably it has, and most important duties in respect to this
matter. It is charged with the general duty of inquiring as to the
management of the business of railroad companies, and to keep itself
informed as to the manner in which the same is conducted, and has
the right to compel complete and full information as to the manner in
which such carriers are transacting their business. And, with this
knowledge, it is charged with the duty of seeing that there is no violation
of the long and short haul clause; that there is no discrimination
between individual shippers, and that nothing is done, by rebate or
any other device, to give preference to one as against another; that
no undue preferences are given to one place or places or individual or
class of individuals, but that in all things that equality of right, which
is the great purpose of the interstate commerce act, shall be secured
to all shippers. It must also see that that publicity which is required
by section 6 is observed by the railroad companies. Holding the railroad
companies to strict compliance with all these statutory provisions,
and enforcing obedience to all these provisions, tends ... to both
reasonableness and equality of rate, as contemplated by the interstate
commerce act."</p></div>

<p>The nadir of government regulation for the time being was
reached in November, 1897,&mdash;six months after the Maximum
Freight Rate decision. A second opinion from the Supreme
Court of the United States in the Alabama Midland (Troy)
case, with one blow practically nullified the long and short haul
clause.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The first opinion had put an end to control over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>reasonableness of rates in and of themselves. This second one
denied the right to establish their reasonableness <i>relatively</i> as
between competing places or markets. In order fully to appreciate
the significance of this decision it will be necessary to
review cursorily the tedious litigation which led up to this
result,&mdash;the entire emasculation of the Fourth section. The
final outcome may be best described by Justice Harlan in his
dissenting opinion in this leading case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Taken in connection with other decisions defining the powers
of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the present decision, it seems
to me, goes far to make that commission a useless body for all practical
purposes, and to defeat many of the important objects designed to be
accomplished by the various enactments of Congress relating to interstate
commerce. The Commission was established to protect the
public against the improper practices of transportation companies
engaged in commerce among the several States. It has been left, it
is true, with power to make reports, and to issue protests. But it
has been shorn, by judicial interpretation, of authority to do anything
of an effective character."</p></div>

<p>The interpretation of the long and short haul clause<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> as
applied to concrete cases by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
was first enunciated in the decision known as the
Louisville &amp; Nashville case.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Immediately after the enactment
of the law, a multitude of petitions were received from
carriers all over the country praying that they be exempted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>from the operation of this clause, which prohibited a greater
charge for a lesser haul than for one over the same line between
points more distant. The policy outlined in the Louisville &amp;
Nashville case, delivered by Judge Cooley, has practically
remained unchanged to the present time. This railroad company
operating a line parallel to the Mississippi, as well as
intersected at various points by its tributary rivers, claimed
that the existence of water competition compelled a rate to all
competitive points, lower than rates which could be made to
local and intermediate stations. It alleged that an adjustment
of its local rates to the low level necessitated at competitive
points, would prove disastrous from the point of view of revenue.
The point at issue was as to the interpretation of the phrase
"under substantially similar circumstances and conditions";
which, in the words of the Act, was necessary in order that the
prohibition of the lesser charge for the longer haul should become
operative. Without entering into the details of this
decision, in the course of which the nature of railroad competition
and of rate making were fully discussed, as well as the legislative
history of this clause of the Act, it will suffice to note the
conclusions. These were; firstly, that the prohibition against
a greater charge for a shorter than for a longer distance over
the same line in the same direction, the shorter being included
within the longer distance, was limited to cases in which the
circumstances and conditions were substantially similar;
secondly, that carriers might judge in the first instance as to
the similarity or dissimilarity of circumstances; but, thirdly,
that this judgment was not final but was subject to review by
the Commission and the courts. Perhaps the most important
point, however, was the determination of the conditions which
constituted such dissimilar circumstances and conditions as
entitled the carrier to charge less for the longer than for the
shorter haul. These conditions were the existence of water
competition; the existence of other railroads not subject to the
statute; and "rare and peculiar" cases of competition between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
railroads which were subject to the law. The Commission also
held as a guiding principle in the interpretation of this clause
that no distinction would be recognized between local traffic
and so-called through business; and also that the expense to
the carrier involved would not be recognized as a factor unless
it happened to come under the case already cited as "rare and
peculiar." Furthermore, the desire to encourage manufactures
or to build up business or trade centres, was not recognized
as a competent reason for claiming exemption from the
prohibition in the Act.</p>

<p>The leading decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
above mentioned, was rendered in 1887. It was not
until October of 1892 that the first serious interference arose
through judicial interpretation in the United States Courts.
The first was the so-called "separate and independent line"
decision.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> This case arose respecting a suit for the repayment
of $225 as overcharges on corn shipped by one Osborne from
Scranton, Iowa, to Chicago. It was claimed that the charges
were unjust and unreasonable, inasmuch as they were in excess
of rates charged from Blair, Nebraska, a point more remote
from Chicago. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals at
St. Paul reversed the decision of the lower court, holding that
the lesser rate from Blair with which the Scranton rate had been
compared, was not a rate to Chicago, but part of an agreed
through rate to New York and other eastern points. Under
this interpretation, the aggregate charge for the longer distance
from Blair to New York was not less than the charge for the
shorter distance from Scranton to Chicago. To this point the
decision was in conformity with the previous interpretation
by the courts and the Commission; which had uniformly held
that a portion of a joint through rate cannot be compared
with local or individual rates in the determination of what
constitutes the rate for the shorter or the longer haul. This
decision went further, however, and therein profoundly affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>the subsequent interpretation of the law. It proceeded to
define the word "line" as used in the Act, by holding that the
joint line formed by two roads is wholly independent of the
two lines represented by the several roads taken separately and
apart. Interpreted in this way, the decision held furthermore
that the total joint rate over two roads, not being over the
"same line," might for anything in the fourth section of the
Act, not only be as low but even lower than the local rate of
either. The effect of this decision was obviously to permit a
railroad to engage in traffic agreements for through carriage
of freight; and by so doing, legally to become a line separate
and independent from the same physical property when engaged
in the transportation of freight over its own line. Moreover,
by every contract for through carriage of freight with
different carriers, the road became a separate and independent
line in the eyes of the law. As many lines could exist over one
set of rails as there were traffic agreements for through haulage
of freight between its terminal points.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>The apprehension of the Interstate Commerce Commission
that this interpretation of the word line might render the
Fourth section of the Act inoperative, was realized in the following
year. Several decisions not only adopted the <i>obiter
dictum</i> of the Osborne case, above described, but proceeded to
expand upon it. Thus, for example, in the Georgia Federal
Court, a case arose involving rates from the North to Atlanta
as compared with the higher rates to intermediate points.
The court held that traffic from Cincinnati to Augusta or Atlanta
was carried over a different line than that which was used
for transportation to points intermediate between Atlanta and
Augusta; inasmuch as the several carriers agreeing upon the
joint rate as far as Atlanta from the North, were different.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>
<p>Moreover it held that the road from Atlanta to Augusta being
wholly within the state of Georgia, might by making a local
rate from Atlanta which was added to the through rate into
Atlanta, constitute itself merely a state road, and therefore be
exempted from the prohibition of the Act. Thus it appeared,
to quote from the report of the Commission for 1893, "that in
addition to the embarrassments proposed by the original 'line'
decision, the very jurisdiction of the law itself is invaded by the
extension of the line theory indulged in by the Georgia Federal
court."</p>

<p>The interpretation put upon the Fourth section of the Act
by the decision above cited, remained in force and largely
nullified application of the Act itself until 1896. The next
important interpretation came, in the decision by the Supreme
Court of the United States in the so-called "Social Circle"
case.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> This decision fully discussed the interpretation placed
upon the word "line" in the Act. The rates involved were
those on buggies from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Social Circle, a local
station between Augusta and Atlanta, Georgia. Following
the practice of the carriers for some years, the Georgia Railroad
Company, which alone served the town of Social Circle, had
requested its connections at Atlanta not to name through rates
to that place or any other local station on its road. The
Circuit Court following the line of argument already described,
had held that under such circumstances the Georgia railroad
was only a local carrier and not a party to a joint or common
arrangement, which would make it subject to the control of
the Federal Commission. The Supreme Court reversed this
opinion, however; and held that when goods are shipped on a
through bill of lading, they constitute an interstate carriage
subject to Federal supervision and control. The court held
further that this state road became part of a continuous line,
not by consolidation with other companies, but by a traffic
arrangement for continuous carriage or shipment. The Supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>Court interpreted the original Osborne decision as merely
affirming that a railroad company doing business in one state
could not be compelled to enter into any agreement with connecting
carriers. For by so doing, it continued, the carrier
might be deprived of its rights and powers to make rates on its
own road. Viewed in this way a carrier might agree to form a
continuous line for carrying foreign freight at a through rate
without being prevented from charging ordinary local rates for
state traffic. Stripped of legal verbiage, this interpretation by
the Supreme Court, virtually overruled the previous decisions
by lower courts, and rehabilitated the original interpretation
of the word "line" by the Commission; namely, that when a
continuous line for through traffic is formed by several railroads,
the roads constituting that line and making use of it are merely
parts of one through route and are not separate lines. In
short, not being able to constitute themselves as separate lines
by reason of traffic contracts, they must continue to conform
their through charges to the rates which they have made upon
local business. So far as the enforcement of the Fourth section
was concerned, therefore, developments to this point had
upheld the law as originally passed.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> It remained, however,
for a separate and distinct course of judicial interpretation to
once more jeopardize both the practical operation of the law
and the power of the Commission.</p>

<p>Reverting to the original Louisville &amp; Nashville decision
in 1887, it will appear that the Commission held at that time
that competition between carriers subject to the Act, did not
constitute such dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions
as would justify the carriers in making their long distance
rates lower than the rates between intermediate points. The
only exception recognized at that time was to be found in
certain "rare and peculiar" cases.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> One of these will suffice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>as an illustration. There are two routes by which traffic from
Youngstown, Ohio, may reach the East. One is by way of
Pittsburg and the Pennsylvania Railroad; the other by an outlet
to the north, at Ashtabula upon the Lake Shore and New
York Central trunk lines. Between Youngstown, Ohio, and
Pittsburg, two parallel lines exist, each having an interest in
forwarding freight to the East by the two routes above mentioned.
The peculiarity of the situation is that competitive
traffic for the East may leave Pittsburg in either direction. If
it goes around by Youngstown, that place becomes an intermediate
point between Pittsburg and New York. If, on the
other hand, it goes from Pittsburg directly east, Youngstown
becomes not an intermediate point, but one more remote than
Pittsburg from New York. Inasmuch as the Pennsylvania
route from Pittsburg is the shorter, it makes the rate.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> The
other roundabout route is obliged to accede to this compelled
rate or lose the business. The result is that the smaller indirect
road is obliged to give a lower rate from Pittsburg round by
way of Youngstown to New York than it gives to Youngstown
itself. Any other course of action would deprive it of any participation
in Pittsburg business. Such, then, is one of those
"rare and peculiar" cases under which the Commission from
the first recognized the necessity of exempting carriers, even
where all are subject to the Act, from the prohibition of charging
less for a shorter than for a longer haul over the same line.</p>

<p>The carriers from the outset had made a determined effort
to show that the competition of carriers among themselves was
sufficient to produce that dissimilarity of circumstances and
conditions which would justify exemption from the Act. This
contention the Commission refused to recognize, and did so
particularly in the important decisions of 1892 known as the
Georgia Railroad Commission cases.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> These again, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>Maximum Freight Rate case, involved rates from Cincinnati to
various points throughout the South; and had reference particularly
to the prevalent practice of granting low rates to certain
important centres known as basing points. In this decision
the Commission re-affirmed the principles set forth in the
Louisville &amp; Nashville case, except in one detail; namely, as
to whether the carriers were justified in deciding for themselves
in first instance whether a case of railroad competition was of
that type already defined as "rare and peculiar" which would
permit exemption from the long and short haul prohibition.
Experience of five years had shown that the right of decision
in this respect had led to manifold abuses; inasmuch as a
strong disposition on the part of the carriers all over the country
was shown to interpret all cases of railroad competition, however
simple, as "rare and peculiar." The Commission, therefore,
proceeded to overrule its earlier decision; and denied the right
on the part of carriers to determine for themselves as to what
constituted dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions,
affirming that that right was its own.</p>

<p>All of the foregoing judicial interpretation is secondary in
importance to the final decision of the United States Supreme
Court in 1897 in what is known as the Alabama Midland case.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
This once and for all overruled the interpretation placed upon
the law by the Commission, that railroad competition did not
constitute that dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions
which would entitle a carrier to exemption from the prohibitions
of the statute. This case, like almost all the others involving
the interpretation of the Fourth section, arose upon complaint
of a small town in the southern states that more important trade
centres were securing advantages in the matter of rates which
were denied to it. The Board of Trade of Troy, Alabama,
complained that it was compelled to pay $3.22 a ton on phosphate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>rock from Florida and South Carolina points, whereas
the rate to Montgomery, a longer distance, was only $3.00 per
ton. The rock was carried through Troy. It was also complained
that rates on cotton discriminated against Troy as
compared with Montgomery and other points; and that, thirdly,
rates from Baltimore and New York were higher to Troy than
to Montgomery, which was fifty-two miles further away. The
case was carried on appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States, where an opinion was handed down in 1896. The gist
of this decision was that competition, whether of trade centres
or of railroads, must be recognized as a factor in the determination
of the similarity of circumstances and conditions under
which the Fourth section of the clause should be applied. In
other words, it recited that Montgomery being a larger place
than Troy; and having been an important trade centre on a
navigable river for many years, it was competent to the railroads
centering at Montgomery to determine in part for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>selves
whether the existence of effective competition would
warrant them in granting lower rates to Montgomery than to
local stations like Troy. The court held, however, that such
competition was only one of the elements which must be considered.
It did not define it as the dominating one. The
railroads, nevertheless, seized upon this interpretation of the
law at once, making use of it to justify whatever departure they
pleased to make from the practice originally contemplated in
adjusting long and short haul charges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus500.jpg" width="700" height="697" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the discouraging reverse in the Alabama Midland
decision, which the Commission interpreted to mean that if
circumstances and conditions were different at the more distant
point, that fact, of itself, removed the case from the inhibition
of the Fourth section; certain inferior Federal court opinions
somewhat modified this view.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> The question as to whether
the discrimination at bar was or was not justifiable, was permitted
to be considered; in addition to inquiring merely whether
circumstances and conditions were different at the more distant
point. The Commission somewhat reanimated by these
decisions, sought to apply this judicial modification of the
Alabama Midland reasoning to several then pending complaints
as to local discrimination. Both in the Danville<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and
Hampton cases<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> the carriers were ordered to desist from discriminating
against the nearer point under this interpretation
of the law. But the Supreme Court put an end to it all by
condemning this line of reasoning in its last leading decision
upon the Fourth section rendered in 1901, finally disposing of
the so-called Chattanooga case. This dealt the final death
blow to the long and short clause.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> The complaint in this case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>arose from the fact that freight rates to Chattanooga, Tennessee,
from eastern cities were higher than to Nashville, although the
latter was the more distant point. The Commission found
that there was no water competition at Nashville compelling
the lower rate; but that there was competition of railways and
of markets. The Supreme Court reversed the Commission in
its final attempt thus to revivify the moribund Fourth section,
and fully confirmed its original view as to the meaning of the
Alabama Midland decision. If such circumstances and conditions
as competition of markets or railways at the two points
were dissimilar, carriers might without restraint depart from
the long and short haul rule. Thus the Fourth section of the
law was to all intents and purposes repealed. Complaint after
complaint was perforce set aside by the Commission. For
practical purposes this part of the law was rendered absolutely
nugatory. The chapter was closed. For twenty years, in
face of the litigation above outlined, no order of the Commission
respecting local discrimination was enforced. Only with its
amendment in 1910, as subsequently described,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> did the long
and short haul clause once more resume its due importance
upon the statute books.</p>

<p>One special case may be cited in this general connection, as
typical of the arbitrary action of carriers particularly in the
South. It was this sort of thing which went far to arouse
public opinion and focus attention upon the need for real
regulation.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The situation appears upon the accompanying
map. The planters in a certain southern territory served by
the Louisville &amp; Nashville railway had been accustomed to
ship out their cotton to the North by various routes. It might
go by way of New Orleans, <i>via</i> Pensacola, up the main line
along the Mississippi valley, or be hauled eastward to Savannah
and other Atlantic ports, and thence go by vessel to New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>England. Inasmuch as the through rate was the same by all
routes, no monetary issue to the planter was involved. But not
so to the railway. For by the first routes it secured a long
haul; while by the last it not only was limited to short carriage
of the goods, but was compelled to accept an even smaller
fraction of the joint through rate. In this case the Louisville
&amp; Nashville railway&mdash;which, by the way, more persistently
denied the existence of abuses than any other road in the
country&mdash;advanced the Savannah cotton rate arbitrarily in
1899 from $2.75 to $3.30 a bale. This effectually dammed up
the eastern outlet and jeopardized the interests of the port of
Savannah to that degree. Doubtless the Louisville &amp; Nashville
was not oblivious to the welfare of that great seaport.
It could not afford to be, for Savannah's growth must indirectly
accrue to its benefit. It did not love Savannah less; but it
loved its own particular seaport, Pensacola, or the long haul
<i>via</i> Louisville, more. Maybe it was better that traffic should
go out this way&mdash;who knew best? The real point to be made
is that no competent tribunal or process for impartially determining
the question was provided by the now emasculated
law.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus503.jpg" width="700" height="271" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The work of the Commission during these discouraging
years was naturally affected most profoundly by these limitations
placed upon its activity by the Federal courts. The
number of formal complaints, never large, steadily dwindled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
year by year. Thirty-nine were filed in 1892; but in 1900 and
the following year only nineteen were presented annually.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
The Commission persisted in its statistical work with marked
success. Important independent investigations continued to
be made, in pursuance of the only policy remaining open to it,
that of publicity. But even the informal complaints, representing
mainly the grievances of individual shippers rather
than of competing cities or commercial bodies, were few in
number, as the following official figures show.</p>

<p>But better times were coming. The return of commercial
prosperity brought with it new problems. Old abuses, quiescent
during the long industrial depression of 1893-1897, once
more made their appearance. New constructive legislation
followed, based as before upon the economic needs of the time,
as they made themselves manifest; but a great campaign of
education, led by the vigorous personality of Theodore Roosevelt,
was necessary, as we shall see, to compel Congress to act.</p>

<p>The new incentives to rehabilitation of the Interstate Commerce
law by Congress, becoming year by year more insistent
after 1899, were four in number. Most of the old long-standing
grievances were still on the docket. New sources of dissatisfaction
and danger were now added in plenty as a result of
important industrial changes. The most far-reaching of these
was the spread of consolidation among railroads. This, as we
shall see,<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> led within a few years to a partition of the entire
railway net of the country into a few large systems, each controlled
financially, although seldom by actual majority investment,
by powerful individuals or banking groups, mainly
located in New York. Many small local roads, long closely
identified with the welfare of particular communities, were now
merged in great systems under entirely different and probably
absentee ownership and management. Boston, Baltimore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>New Orleans, St. Paul, Cincinnati, not to mention a host of
other smaller places, seemed commercially cast adrift. The
welfare of railroads and of the particular communities in which
they lay,&mdash;long supposed to be indissolubly linked together,&mdash;was
now seen by concrete experience to be separable, often
into conflicting parts. The New Haven monopoly in New
England might be managed rather in the interest of New York
than of the port of Boston. The Illinois Central, once devoted
whole-heartedly to the upbuilding of New Orleans, must now,
as a part of the Union Pacific system, comprehend San Francisco
and even Savannah within the scope of its plans. New
systems implied new traffic arrangements. Railroad policy
must of necessity involve a choice, not between two evils,
perhaps, but between a resultant good and a necessarily attendant
evil. All these corporate changes made inevitably
for much commercial readjustment. And each readjustment
left a trail of real or alleged grievances; for the settlement of
which no competent tribunal existed. There can be no doubt,
therefore, that the significant changes in the railroad map
after 1899 had much to do with the demand for new
legislation.</p>

<p>The second new and general cause of dissatisfaction among
the public was the great and almost continuous rise of freight
rates which began about 1900. This was of course a direct
outcome of the spread of railroad consolidation. The movement
of freight rates has been elsewhere described in detail.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
It has appeared that the steady decline which ensued for almost
a generation after the panic of 1873, was sharply reversed when
combination succeeded competition as a fundamental policy of
railroading. This striking reversal of the course of railway
charges was not, of course, an isolated phenomenon. It took
place in a period of marked and general rise of prices, not unconnected
with changes in the value of gold. The upward
trend was at first more striking, and apparently more irresistible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>in the charges for transportation than in the prices of commodities.
Prior to 1899, not even the most astute railroad managers
ever anticipated any such change. The Boston &amp; Maine Railroad
even permitted the inclusion of a prohibition of any
higher rates in future than were then in force, to be incorporated
in the acts of the New Hampshire legislature authorizing its
leases of important lines. Attorneys sought to prove that
railroads were not subject to the law of increasing returns,
because it was <i>inevitable</i> as an economic law that with growth
in the volume of business, rates should progressively decline.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
If there was often public dissatisfaction at the scale of charges
under these conditions, how irresistible might the unrest among
shippers become when rates actually began to move so strongly
upwards!</p>

<p>A single illustration of the class of complaints thus engendered
may not be out of place.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> It concerned the reasonableness
of an increase of two cents per hundred pounds on
lumber from Georgia points to the Ohio river. From 1894 to
1903 these rates had been already raised by three or four cents,
to a level of thirteen or fourteen cents; so that prosperity had
been already discounted by a rise of thirty or forty per cent.
On top of this, and despite an enormous increase in the tonnage,
came a further raise of two cents per hundred pounds in April,
1903. This was too much. To this exaction, involving not
less than $132,000 per year additional freight rates, the lumbermen
of Georgia objected. The Interstate Commerce Commission
upheld their contention; and in July, 1905, more than
two years afterward, the Circuit Court sustained the Commission.
Appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court which
rendered a decision in 1907, more than four years after the
increase had occurred; and during which time the railroads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>had been collecting the added charge. The shippers had naturally
at once shifted the burden upon the public so far as the
competition of other lumber-producing centres, each championed
by its own railroad or set of roads, would permit.
No recovery of this tax, now held to be unjust by the highest
court in the land, could possibly be had. The loss was irreparable.
The frequency of complaints of this sort, involving
the absolute reasonableness of rates, proves conclusively how
potent a factor in furthering legislation the rise of the scale of
charges had become.</p>

<p>The demonstration of the menace to public welfare of an
inordinate concentration of financial power in the hands of a
few privileged individuals, served a useful end in bringing about
new legislation. The general rise of rates had been a direct
outcome of the substitution of combination for competition
among railroads. The danger of absolute dominion over all
trade, commerce and finance without accountability to the
law, was a concomitant of the growth of great railroad systems.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
A special investigation in 1905 showed, for example, that the
majorities of the boards of directors of practically all of the
roads east of the Mississippi river might be selected from a
group of only thirty-nine persons. The spectacular career of
Edward H. Harriman with the Union Pacific and other companies
was a convincing argument in itself. The disclosures
in the New York insurance investigation of 1905 as to the
intricate ramifications of financial power came, as will shortly
appear, at a most opportune time for promoting congressional
activity. The need of it was, perhaps, never more clearly shown
than in the following frank admission by Mr. Harriman in
December, 1906,&mdash;only a few months after the law had been
amended,&mdash;made in the course of a general investigation of
railroad consolidations by the Interstate Commerce Commission.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p>Questioned as to where his policy of acquisition was to
end, the following colloquy ensued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A. I would go on with it. If I thought we could realize something
more than we have got from these investments I would go on and
buy some more things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Q. Supposing that you got the Santa Fe?</p>

<p>"A. You would not let us get it.</p>

<p>"Q. How could we help it?</p>

<p>"A. How could you help it? I think you would bring out your
power to enforce the conditions of the Sherman anti-trust act pretty
quick. If you will let us, I will go and take the Santa Fe to-morrow.</p>

<p>"Q. You would take it to-morrow?</p>

<p>"A. Why, certainly I would; I would not have any hesitation;
it is a pretty good property.</p>

<p>"Q. Then it is only the restriction of the law that keeps you from
taking it?</p>

<p>"A. I would go on as long as I live.</p>

<p>"Q. Then after you had gotten through with the Santa Fe and
had taken it, you would also take the Northern Pacific and Great
Northern, if you could get them?</p>

<p>"A. If you would let me.</p>

<p>"Q. And your power, which you have, would gradually increase
as you took one road after another, so that you might spread not only
over the Pacific coast, but spread out over the Atlantic coast?</p>

<p>"A. Yes."</p></div>

<p>Was there ever a clearer case of megalomania, menacing the
welfare of a great people?</p>

<p>But it was not alone the dangers incident to monopoly in
transportation which excited popular alarm. There was the ever
increasing danger of abuse of monopolistic power by the newly
created industrial combinations. Most of these had sprung
up overnight in the great promotion movement of 1899-1901.
The general public had long been aware of the gross favoritism
in transportation, which had created the Standard Oil Company.
It knew something of the power of the beef packers'
monopoly, built up by the use of private car lines. But with
the publication of Miss Tarbell's History of the Standard Oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
Company in 1903-1904, followed by the reports of the United
States Commissioner of Corporations in 1906, its attention
was newly directed to the evil.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Even the carriers themselves
were now roused to protest by the pressure for secret favors
by large shippers. The Elkins amendments to the law in 1903,
as we shall see, enabled the government to convict many offenders.
But even this new law was not enough. The rebating
still went on, under new and ingenious forms. If the United
States Steel Corporation, the "Sugar Trust," the International
Harvester Company, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
and a host of others were not restrained, monopoly in transportation
would soon be followed by monopoly in manufacture.
Each new disclosure verified the suspicions of the public as to
the magnitude of these abuses. The necessity of a special
corrective was first applied to rebating; but this action in turn
only served to re&euml;nforce the popular conviction that more
general legislation was necessary. The Elkins amendments
of 1903 surely paved the way for the Hepburn law three years
thereafter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The so-called Elkins amendments to the Act of 1887,&mdash;the
first changes of importance in its substantive clauses,&mdash;were
made in 1903, in response to a demand of the carriers.
Educated to a sense of the grave losses of revenue incident to
rebating and general rate cutting, prominent railroad men
united in urging Congress to act. The ease and decorum with
which this legislation was passed is, in itself, eloquent testimony
to the organized influence of the railroads over Congress, which
made itself felt during the next few years in opposition to
further changes in the law for the benefit of the public. The
entire inadequacy of the original act to prevent rebating had
been proven time and again. The Interstate Commerce Commission
had done its best. The Department of Justice had
attempted to apply the equity processes of injunction without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
much result. Other Federal laws had been invoked in vain.
When the carriers themselves asked for more stringent legislation,
it was accorded by Congress with commendable despatch.
No opposition whatever appeared. Nor was there much debate.
The machinery of legislation moved expeditiously and
almost without noise to the desired end.</p>

<p>These Elkins amendments dealt solely with the provisions
of law concerning observance of published tariffs. They in
no wise affected the determination of what those tariffs should
be. That problem of reasonableness was the bone of contention
in the great struggle in Congress, hardly as yet under
way but soon to follow. The changes in 1903, therefore, had
mainly to do with penalties and legal procedure. They were,
as elsewhere outlined, five in number. The railroad corporation
itself,&mdash;and not merely its officers and agents as heretofore,&mdash;was
made liable to prosecution and penalty. This put an end
to the anomalous immunity hitherto enjoyed by the principal
and beneficiary of a guilty transaction. Secondly, the penalty
of imprisonment for departure from the published tariff,&mdash;added
to the law in 1889 in the hope of rendering it more effective,&mdash;was
removed. It had been hoped that the reluctance
of witnesses to become parties to such condign punishment of
associates might thus be somewhat overcome; especially since
the liability to fines now ran to the corporation rather than to
the individual. The third change in the law was of great
importance, as it had been construed by the courts. Preferential
treatment of shippers had been made to depend upon
proof; first, that rates lower than as published in the tariff had
actually been allowed; and, in the second place, that these full
tariff rates, or, at least, higher rates, had been paid by others
on like shipments at the same time. Such proof had turned
out to be practically impossible in any general rate war; inasmuch
as, at such times, rates were cut more or less substantially
for all shippers alike. In other words, there might well be
departure from the published rates, without preferential treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>ment.
And it was the object of the law to put a stop to both of
these abuses. The Elkins law, therefore, explicitly made the
published tariff the standard of lawfulness. Any departure from
it, proven by itself alone, was declared a misdemeanor. In
the fourth place, the new law made shippers or any other interested
parties defendants; whereas formerly only the giver of
rebates, not the recipient, could be prosecuted. This change
rendering the guilty shipper liable, was an eminently proper
one. And then, finally, the new law provided for the issuance
of injunctions,&mdash;viz., peremptory orders punishable by contempt
of court,&mdash;by any Federal judge whenever the Interstate
Commerce Commission had reasonable ground for belief
that any common carrier was deviating from the published
tariff, "or is committing any discrimination forbidden by law."
A summary prohibition from this judicial source, it was hoped,
would act as a powerful deterrent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The enactment of more general remedial legislation than
the Elkins amendments was a far more serious matter. That
statute has not inaptly been described as "not even a preliminary
skirmish. It was a truce of the principals to abolish
piracy." The original law of 1887 was avowedly experimental
and imperfect. With this in view the statute had specifically
directed that there should be transmitted to Congress in its
annual reports "such recommendations as to additional
legislation ... as the Interstate Commerce Commission may deem
necessary." This duty was conscientiously performed year
by year. One may find, therefore, in these documents, especially
after 1896, the most convincing presentation of the need
for amendment of the law. Yet despite its importance, Congress
was for some years so intent upon more pressing public
business, that no action was taken in the matter. Currency
legislation, the Spanish War and the Philippines, the Isthmian
Canal, pure food and the trusts quite engrossed public attention.
And, oddly enough, when the campaign opened seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
in 1899, activity was for a time confined mainly to the Senate.
This was in sharp contrast with the situation both before 1887
and after 1905, when the upper house was the obstructive
member.</p>

<p>As early as 1894 the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce
had reported favorably a bill; but nothing came of it.
Five years later, both Senators Cullom of Illinois,&mdash;sponsor
for the original law,&mdash;and Chandler of New Hampshire introduced
bills. All these measures aimed to confer rate-making
power upon the commission and to expedite judicial procedure
upon appeal. In the meantime important organizations,
especially in the West, such as the National Board of Trade and
the Conventions of State Railroad Commissioners, had taken
the matter up. Much evidence was heard by the United States
Industrial Commission which dealt with it in an elaborate report
in 1901.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The chances seemed favorable for action. The
Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce in that year added
several progressively inclined members. The general freight
rate increases of 1900 had greatly stirred the people. But at
this juncture the powerful new financial influences, concerned
with the formation of the great transportation systems, came
into play. Effective regulation might interfere with some of
these plans. The matter was becoming serious. Railroad
opposition began to organize. It became clear that a bitter
contest would be needed to secure legislation.</p>

<p>Renewed pressure from the public came in 1902. Senator
Chandler had been retired by direct railroad influence in New
Hampshire. But Senator Cullom again brought in a bill,<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
which was consolidated with another by Senator Nelson of
Minnesota. Public interest was plainly rising; yet these
measures all died in committee. And the House of Representatives
was too busy with other concerns. But in 1903,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>for the first time, the lower house devoted some attention to
the so-called Cooper-Quarles bill;<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> although no vote was
taken. It did, however, with little debate, as we have seen,
grant what the railroads asked for the suppression of rebating
in the passage of the Elkins amendments. The necessity of
general legislation on the subject was not yet strongly felt.
The trusts, floundering in the panic of 1903, seemed more
threatening to public order than the railroads. Only in a few
communities like Wisconsin under the able leadership of Governor
La Follette, had public opinion become sufficiently aroused
to achieve definite results.</p>

<p>Matters were finally brought to a head by the determined
attitude of President Roosevelt. In his annual message to
Congress in 1904 he made railroad regulation "a paramount
issue." The remedies proposed differed little from those of the
bills above mentioned. The cardinal point was that the Interstate
Commerce Commission was to be given power to prescribe
actual rates, to be effective until reversed by the courts. Under
this spur, the House of Representatives passed the so-called
Esch-Townshend bill&mdash;an administration measure&mdash;by the
impressive majority of 326 to 17. It was now the Senate's
turn to delay. It, however, authorized its Interstate Commerce
Committee to sit during the spring and summer, and
to report in December.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> A mass of testimony was taken,
which despite the activity of a powerful body of paid railroad
attorneys, proved to be most convincing. But even more
cogent proof of the need of control was the outrageous attempt
of the carriers to influence popular opinion through so-called
publicity bureaus.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> An extensive service, regardless of cost,
was set up with headquarters at Washington and with branches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>in all the leading cities, headed by the President of the Southern
Railway. Bogus conventions, packed for the purpose,&mdash;such
as the "Alabama Commercial and Industrial Association,"&mdash;passed
resolutions unanimously, to be scattered broadcast by
free telegraphic despatches all over the country. "Associations
for the Maintenance of Property" held conventions; the fact
being duly advertised. Palpably garbled news items from
Washington were distributed without cost, especially during
the hearings of the Senate Committee. Even more insidious
and misleading methods were employed. An elaborate card
catalogue of small newspapers throughout the United States
was made; in which was noted all of the hobbies, prejudices,
and even the personal weaknesses of the editors. One of the
cards is reproduced on this page. Magazine sections or "ready
to print" insides were also made up, in which appropriate and
subtle references to railroad issues were concealed in a mass of
general reading matter. Two or three weekly letters were
sent gratis to minor newspapers without regular Washington
correspondents, containing "good railroad doctrine," together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
with spicy local news items. Dakota farmers got suggestions
as to the danger of the proposed legislation affecting their rates.
Kentucky planters were warned of the probable effect upon tobacco
prices. As an indication of the formidable proportions of
this campaign of education, the Chicago office, alone, employed
some forty highly paid experts. Regular reports were rendered
by this news service to the railroads' committee, as to the
results achieved; setting forth the number of columns of news
matter distributed and the changes effected in the proportion
of "pro" and "con" items published. It was indeed a most
astounding demonstration of the lengths to which organized
corporate power would go to defeat regulative legislation.
That it proved upon exposure to be a boomerang for the railroad
cause, is to be inferred from the entire absence of all such
political methods from the succeeding campaigns dealing with
further amendment of the law.</p>

<p>The President again insisted upon action in the annual
message of 1905, this time recommending control over maximum,
not absolute, rates.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Executive pressure was brought
to bear heavily upon Congress. The public was plainly becoming
insistent; with the result that the so-called Hepburn
bill was passed by 346 votes to 7. Whether the Senate, under
the influence of one of the most powerful lobbies ever let loose
upon a legislative body, would have yielded even then, had it
not been for an extraordinary conjuncture of economic events,
one dare not surmise. The general causes of dissatisfaction,
already described, such as the spread of combination, the
growth of autocratic power, the steady rise of freight rates and
the abuses of personal favoritism had been long at work. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>now at the psychological moment came the general breakdown
and congestion of railroad service all over the country;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
the insurance investigation in New York; the Pennsylvania
Railroad coal car scandal;<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> the Atchison rebate disclosures,
with "barefaced disregard of the law," besmirching a member

publicity campaign methods of the carriers. The evidence
was cumulative and overwhelming as to the need of action.
The Senate was forced to acquiesce in a conference committee
bill, passing it at the end with only three dissenting votes.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> On
June 29, 1906, the Hepburn bill became law. The fundamental
principle of governmental control over the most powerful
corporations in the country had been fully affirmed. It was an
historic event,&mdash;the most important, perhaps, in Theodore
Roosevelt's public career,&mdash;and a not insignificant one in our
national history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Hepburn law of 1906, in the first place, greatly broadened
the field of Federal regulation.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> This was now extended
to cover both express and sleeping-car companies. Pipe lines,&mdash;such
powerful factors in the creation of monopoly in the oil
business as opportunely showed by the Report of the Commissioner
of Corporations in 1906,&mdash;were expressly included.
"Transportation" was now broadly defined as comprehending
among other things, "all services in connection with the receipt,
delivery, elevation, and transfer in transit, ventilation, refrigeration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>or icing, storage, and handling of property transported."
Whether certain of these powers, especially over pipe lines, are
practically enforcible as well as legally sound, remains yet to
be seen. The inclusion of all switches, spurs, and terminal
facilities, with appurtenances of all sorts, was an added detail
of importance, in view of the complicated uses made of them
in connection with rebating, as elsewhere described. And the
express power to require facilities for shipment, as well as to
regulate joint rates and services in every detail, was yet another
notable extension of Federal authority. Part-rail and part-water
transportation was included; but coastwise and inland
traffic exclusively by water, was left out. In view of its intimate
relation to rates and services by rail, this omission was
unfortunate. The notorious instability of water rates and the
difficulties incident to the enforcement of the long and short
haul clause, render such water-borne traffic of great importance
in the proper regulation of carriers on land.</p>

<p>The significance of the Hepburn law, however, was not
primarily in the wider scope of Federal control. The heart of
it consisted of its more intensive character. The rate-making
power of the Commission was greatly increased. Two other
points were contested with equal vigor, viz., the scope of judicial
review of decisions of the Commission, and the question
as to whether its orders in cases appealed should take effect at
once, or only upon final judgment by the Federal court. Viewed
in a large way, however, all three of these propositions depended
upon the determination of a basic issue. A clear separation of
powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches
of government was a fundamental principle in our Federal
Constitution. It was generally agreed that a considerable
confusion of functions, laid upon the Commission by the original
law, must in future be avoided. Here, it was said, was a body
which, if empowered to make rates, would be exercising a legislative
function; if applying and enforcing them, would be
acting administratively; and if hearing complaints, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
be serving as a court. It was generally conceded, nevertheless,
except by a few extremists, that the time had now come when
some competent tribunal must be provided for the effective
and prompt settlement of transportation disputes. To which
one of these three branches of the government should this important
duty be assigned? In other words, disregarding mere
matters of detail, should the Interstate Commerce Commission
or the Federal courts be charged with the real control of the
common carriers of the country?</p>

<p>The alignment upon this question was clearly defined. The
administration and the representatives of the shippers and the
general public, were unanimously agreed that control of rates
and regulations, to be effective must be through an administrative
agency,&mdash;a body, that is to say, attached to the executive
branch of the government. Their reasons will be set
forth in due time. On the other hand every railroad proposition
was based upon the exercise of real control by the judiciary.
The Commission, as an administrative body, was not to be
abolished; but in all matters of rate regulation it was to be
subordinated to the courts. The motives for this policy will
also appear shortly. Senator Foraker of Ohio,&mdash;soon retired
because of his uncompromisingly pro-railroad attitude,&mdash;proposed
to strip the Commission of all rate-making power
whatsoever; and to reduce it to an initiating body which should
merely certify all complaints to the Federal courts for settlement.
Senator Elkins of West Virginia,&mdash;an equally ardent
railroad representative,&mdash;introduced a bill to create a special
transportation court, subordinate only to the Supreme Court
of the United States on questions of law. Until this tribunal
had heard the cause, and had sanctioned interference on the
ground of unreasonableness, the Interstate Commerce Commission
might not intervene.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> And in any event its functions were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>to be mainly connected with the enforcement, not the promulgation,
of orders as to rates or service. These plans favoring
the carriers' interests, as we shall see, were all based upon the
proposition that Congress could not constitutionally delegate
general rate making, that is to say, legislative power to an
administrative body.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of clothing an administrative body
with large regulative power by act of Congress, was, of course,
essential to the administration's plan. It was urged that there
was one exception to the general rule that power delegated
to Congress to legislate under the Constitution could not be
further delegated. "There may be such delegation where the
purpose in the original conferring of the power can be subserved
only by its delegation to an agent. Obviously Congress cannot
spend time and labor upon rate making, even were it economically
competent to do so. If the power is to be exercised at
all, practically, it can be done only through an agency like the
Commission." Congress certainly could not delegate such
legislative power, viz., power to make rates, to the courts.
That would even more flagrantly transgress the constitutional
rule. In brief, any plan for judicial control meant the exclusion
of rate regulation in any thoroughgoing way. And that, of
course, was the reason why the "railroad Senators" all insisted
upon such a plan. Other support for the administration plan
was found in the <i>dictum</i> of the court in the Maximum Rate
case;<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> and in opinions cited by the Attorney-General in a special
message on the subject to the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> These and other points,
such as the bearing of the so-called "preference clause" of the
Federal Constitution requiring equality of treatment in commerce
between all ports of the United States, need not detain
us further. The constitutionality of the amendments have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>now been duly upheld. But, inasmuch as the particular form
which the law assumed was the outcome of these debates, it
is essential that they be reviewed. Other questions of interpretation
at a later time, also follow the same line of cleavage
in debate.</p>

<p>Judicial regulation of common carriers, as proposed by the
railroad advocates, was open to many objections; so controlling
that they fortunately turned the scales in favor of the administration
plan. The first of these was in itself so fatal that it
is almost a work of supererogation to state the others. Judicial
control, as we have seen, had been the outcome under the old
law. It was the desperate plight from which escape was
sought. No decisions could be rendered until the rate or practice
had been put into effect. The denial of power to make
rates for the future had broken down the old law. The stable
door might indeed be closed, but only some years after the
horse had been stolen. Therein lay the primary defect of all
judicial processes. When the bituminous coal-carrying roads
and water lines were collecting fifty cents a ton additional on
10,000,000 tons of coal annually, destined for New England
alone, as a result of the practical elimination of monopoly since
1904, the only effective way to prevent irreparable loss to consumers,
would be to veto the increase before it went into effect.
For a Federal judge to hold it an unreasonable exaction, four
years or even six months after it had been paid, would be of
no benefit to the coal-consuming public, upon which the incidence
of the tax really fell.</p>

<p>The entire futility of judicial control was well exemplified
in the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company case of 1895. This
corporation complained of excessive rates from Pueblo, Colorado,
to San Francisco on iron and steel. The Interstate
Commerce Commission ordered the rates on steel rails not to
exceed forty-five cents per one hundred pounds, or seventy-five
per cent. of the Chicago-San Francisco rate on the same commodity,
whatever that might be. The Southern Pacific, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
pressure, complied with this order for about two years; and
then in 1898 advanced the rate one-third, to sixty cents per
one hundred pounds. Thereupon the Iron Company obtained
an injunction from the United States Circuit Court prohibiting
the violation of the Commission's order. The case went to
the Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed this decree.
Meantime, proceedings before a master had fixed the amount
of damages under the rate increase at $35,300. The court
held that these damages, if due, could be recovered before a
jury which should establish the unreasonableness of the rates
in force. But while this was being done, what became of the
California business of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company?
The Pacific coast was one of its most important markets. The
price of steel rails for competitors from Pittsburg or Europe,
who ship by water, would remain quite undisturbed. It would
be difficult to recover trade when once lost. No damages,
based upon mere increased freight rates, actually paid, would
begin to measure the possible loss. And, moreover, even if
this sum were recovered after prolonged litigation, the situation
would not be remedied. Precisely the same rates which gave
rise to the damages would still be in effect. An indefinite series
of litigations might result, which would harass the company and
perhaps drive it from the field altogether. The outcome of this
Southern Pacific case sufficiently proves, even where the shipper
is a powerful corporation, the futility of seeking redress through
judicial proceedings. Again and again one is forced back to the
same conclusion: that the only remedy for an unjust rate is not
to continue an unfair one and pay damages, but as speedily as
possible to substitute a reasonable charge. How much greater
force has this conclusion for the small shipper, if the remedy
fails even for an industrial combination, powerful enough to
extort secret rebates of $1,000 a day from the Atchison railroad,
as proved in the now celebrated Morton case of 1906!</p>

<p>Other serious objections to judicial control may be briefly
stated. The functions of a court, acting judicially, permit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
reliance as to reasonableness upon only one standard, viz.,
that the rate or practice under consideration will lead to confiscation
of property. The courts can set this maximum limit
to charges; but above that point they are powerless to intervene.
Rates for the future must be judged with the same
freedom exercised by the traffic officials who promulgated them
in first instance. Correction can be applied only by an expert
tribunal, possessed of the same sort of knowledge had by those
who issued the tariff or ordered the practice at the outset.
Of course, the objection of lack of technical knowledge on the
part of judges, might be readily enough overcome by means of
a specialized professional personnel. But the objection that
judicial control, in contradistinction to administrative regulation,
is necessarily intermittent rather than steady and constant
is one not so easily met. As has been recently well said of our
Federal policy toward the trusts, "Government by a series of
explosions is rarely effective." There are too many and too
long intervals between decisions. And then again, there is the
slowness of formal court proceedings and the necessarily conservative
attitude of judges, in matters concerning vested
property rights. These arguments were all unanswerable in
the end. It was inevitable that control should be exercised by
a distinct enlargement of the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, as an adjunct of the executive arm of the
government.</p>

<p>The law of 1906<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> authorized the Commission upon complaint
to "determine and prescribe" just and reasonable maximum
rates, regulations or practices to be thereafter observed; and
to order conformity thereto. Such orders, except for money
payments, were to become effective after thirty days; and were
to remain in force for two years, unless suspended, modified,
or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition
the Commission might order an apportionment of joint rates,
when the carriers are unable to agree upon a division; establish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>through routes; and fix reasonable charges for services or
instrumentalities rendered or provided by shippers. This covers
the case of charges for icing refrigerator cars or for the use
of special equipment.</p>

<p>Fairly general rate-making power was thus conferred upon
the Commission; limited, however, to the adjudication of
specific complaints. But the carriers being routed at this point,
promptly fell back upon a second line of defences. Their
representatives took a stand upon the directly consequent point
of broad review by the Federal courts of the Commission's
orders. It was yet possible to practically nullify administrative
control by according indefinite limits to the appellate
jurisdiction of these courts. Might they pass upon law points
alone; or were they to be empowered to review the entire order
of the Commission? A most brilliant constitutional debate
again took place in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> The first detail concerned
the power of Congress to restrict the right of the lower Federal
Courts to suspend the Commission's orders by writ of injunction.
Any limitation upon this power would, of course, lessen
interference with the Commission's mandates, and greatly promote
a speedy settlement of transportation disputes. Were
these injunctions to be freely issued, holding up the Commission's
orders and thereby leaving the old rate or practice in
effect pending final adjudication, the carriers would, of course,
then have everything to gain and nothing to lose by their issuance.
Every order might be attacked, not with any serious
expectation of final success, but merely to secure the benefit
of the delay. And if, after this delay, the widest possible
scope of review were allowed in the formal trial of the case,
judicial instead of administrative regulation might still be
brought about.</p>

<p>The first essential in the conservative programme, then, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
to ensure the most comprehensive right of review for all cases
appealed. But could Congress by statute limit or define the
exercise of this judicial power on the equity side? There was
no doubt as to its right under the Constitution to create or
abolish Federal courts, other than the Supreme Court. But
could it restrict their judicial functions, legal or equitable,
including primarily the power to issue injunctions? Practically,
the alternative lay either in omitting all reference to the
subject in the amended act, leaving the scope of the courts'
powers to be determined by judicial construction of the statute;
or in attempting to define it specifically, item by item. The
carriers' representatives would not agree to the former course,
lest silence upon this matter, as they averred, might imperil
the constitutionality of the law. Nor could the progressive
reformers refuse a definition of the matter, under suspicion of
bad faith. For if, as they had so stoutly maintained, the constitution
amply safeguarded the rights of appellants without
further prescription, a mere re-affirmation of these rights could
do no harm. The result was a clause so worded as virtually to
satisfy the conservatives; while ostensibly being a compromise.
Power is expressly conferred upon the Circuit Courts,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> by suit
to "enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend" orders or requirements
of the Commission. But this power is limited by the condition
that five days' notice must be given to enable the Commission
to prepare its case for protest. And the hearing must be had
before three Federal judges instead of one. These details were
intended to prevent the issuance of restraining orders for
frivolous or merely obstructive reasons.</p>

<p>The unfortunate feature of this compromise, arrived at only
after weeks of bitter controversy, was its entire indefiniteness
as to the grounds upon which the courts might base their
review of the Commission's orders. It thus stopped short of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
conferring more liberal powers of review for railroads than those
enjoyed under the constitution by all other classes of persons
and property.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> In so far the railroads lost their case. It is
evident that Congress intended to create a really competent
administrative board, with whose orders the courts might interfere
only when those orders were <i>ultra vires</i>, or unconstitutional.
The courts under the law must accord the same consideration
to such decisions, "if regularly made and duly served," as to
an act of Congress, with the presumption always in favor of
validity. Judicial interference might be expected only when
the railroads had a good case. This, at least, was a clear gain.
There was yet another even more important one. Under the
old law the burden of initiative or proof on all cases appealed,
rested upon the Commission. This might now be reversed.
Penalties formerly did not begin to run until the final decision of
the highest court to which appeal was taken, had affirmed the
validity of the Commission's order. Carriers might continue
to disobey with impunity throughout the period of protracted
litigation. But now a penalty of $5,000 a day for each day's
violation of the order, began at the expiration of thirty days.
The initiative to secure relief from this order must now come
from the carrier. It, and not the Commission, became the
petitioner before the courts. A speedier adjudication of contested
cases might far more confidently be expected under such
conditions. But the grounds, legal or economic, upon which
such determination of the reasonableness of the Commission's
orders must rest, were, unfortunately, as we have seen, left
open for judicial interpretation in the course of time.</p>

<p>The railroads won a decided victory in one other bitterly
contested detail of the relation of the Commission to the courts.
The new law still left the old rate or practice of which complaint
had been made, in effect without penalty pending the review<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
of the case. The administration bill would not have permitted
restraining orders to issue until the Commission's decision had
been held unreasonable in formal review. The point appears
to have been decided by Congress upon economically unjustifiable
grounds. The interval of time between the Commission's
decision and the final settlement of the case might be considerable.
Under the old conditions, the carriers had imposed
the burden of disputed rates upon the public. The importance
of this point may be illustrated by the fact that during the
protracted litigation in the Chicago Terminal Charge case,
finally settled in 1909, the sum involved for this period alone
amounted to $3,000,000. Was this fair? The real disputants
after all were not the government and the railway company.
The Commission was supposedly acting impartially as an
umpire. Such being the case, unless it were shown that greater
injustice would result from the change, the natural condition
would seem to be this; that in cases of dispute the decision of
the umpire, and not of the bigger contestant, should prevail
until final settlement of the cause. This would seem to be
the obvious, the natural and the just conclusion from the
premises.</p>

<p>But, the railroads contended, suppose the Commission should
order a rate reduced, as in the Maximum Freight Rate case;
put a lower tariff into effect; and then the courts should ultimately
decide that the original rate ought not to have been
disturbed at all. The railroad meantime would have suffered
a corresponding loss of revenue on all traffic carried at the low
rate. This would certainly be a hardship, and incontrovertibly
unjust. But would it be more so than that the shipper
should unjustly have borne the burden in the contrary case?
As matters then stood, the public was compelled to pay the
high rate, even if the courts afterward decided it to have been
unreasonable. The railway as an interested party enjoyed the
benefit of the doubt, and imposed the burden of proof upon the
public at all times. Would it not have been more in consonance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
with justice, that the government, an impartial umpire, should
temporarily lay the burden upon that party against whose
contention the greatest reasonable doubt existed?</p>

<p>The only just remedy would seem to be one which would
insure final recovery for unreasonable rates, by whichever party
paid, during the uncertain period of adjudication. One of the
principal objections of the railways to the proposed change
arose at this point. Large corporations are more responsible
parties at law than most individual shippers. Suppose, through
an unjustly low rate, a railway had suffered loss of revenue;
could it as readily recoup itself by suits for damages against
scores of shippers, large and small, as could the latter, in the
contrary case, recover back from the railway company? This
cogent argument suggested a compromise measure. Why not
permit the original railroad rate to continue in force, as before,
pending final adjudication; but require the carriers to give bond
for prompt repayment of any surplus charges over those finally
sanctioned by the courts?<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> This would have left the business
of rate making in railway hands; and yet have afforded a
substantial remedy for the disputatious shipper.</p>

<p>The railways would not accede to such a compromise measure,
with all the financial burdens thereby entailed. Unfortunately
even this scheme is woefully short of a just solution.
The whole matter looms up larger at this point. Enter again
the interests of the real consumer! In most cases freight rates
to some degree affect the price of commodities. Has the shipper,
having paid a freight bill afterward adjudged unreasonably
high, any right to sue for recovery of the amount? Has he not,
with his fellow merchants, probably shifted the burden upon
the public? Evidence shows that carload rates on cattle from
Texas to South Dakota have been increased within ten years
after 1898, from sixty-five dollars to one hundred dollars. Probably
part of this thirty-five dollars increase has been taken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
the profits of the cattlemen; but can there be doubt that a part
of it has been added to the price of beef?<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> No, tackle it as you
will, from whatever point of view, you return to the same
proposition: that the damage of an unreasonable freight rate,
once paid, is irreparable. Particular shippers may recover what
seem to be damages; but which are likely not to have been so
to them individually at all.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> By standards of abstract justice,
the real solution should distribute the temporary burdens
incident to the delays of legal procedure, as nearly evenly as
the laws of chance will permit. A compilation in 1905 showed
that, of 316 freight rate cases decided by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, fifty-four per cent.&mdash;practically one half&mdash;turned
in favor of the complainant. Inasmuch as these complaints
were practically all brought on behalf of shippers against
the railroads, this shows how evenly balanced the issues have
been. Were the orders of the Commission to become effective
at once, the losses incident to errors afterward corrected by the
courts, would be distributed in about equal proportions. Under
the law even as amended in 1906, all the penalty of a mistake
falls upon the shipper and the public; the railway always goes
scot free. An impartial commission should be clothed with
power to distribute these onerous burdens by prescribing the
temporary rate. Quite possibly the limitation of the equity
power of Federal judges to protect the railroads in their constitutional
rights, might have been overthrown by the Supreme
Court; but the advantage in the contrary case would have been
well worth the risk.</p>

<p>The only remedy left for the public under the circumstances
of compromise above outlined, was to forward the course of
judicial procedure in every way. The Expedition Act of 1903
had done much. The new amendments went still further, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>providing for appeal directly to the Supreme Court with the
privilege of precedence upon its docket. Other details served
the same purpose. Formerly it had taken much time for the
Commission to prepare its formal orders and its <i>prima facie</i>
case for the courts. All the evidence had to be duly set forth.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
Except for damage suits, all this was now changed. The Commission
in its orders need only state its conclusions in the premises,
without the delays, labor and expense incident to formal
re-examination of witnesses and the preparation of extended
records of evidence. This has materially expedited the settlement
of contested cases. It has yet another advantage. The
Commission was stripped of one of its semi-judicial functions;
always an anomaly under our plan of government. And the
assignment of the duty of formal prosecution of cases on appeal
to the Attorney-General of the United States, was yet another
improvement along the same line.</p>

<p>In the matter of personal discrimination, the disheartening
persistence of illegal practices, despite the provisions of the
Elkins law of 1903, rendered it necessary to specifically extend
jurisdiction of the Commission over private car lines; and to
confer authority over all incidental services at terminals.
Separate publication of storage, icing and other charges was
called for; and railroads were held responsible for the provision
of special equipment when requested. Industrial railroads,
"tap lines," spurs and sidings, so ingeniously employed in discrimination,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
were expressly included under the Commission's
authority. Passes for individuals, a fruitful source of favoritism
and political corruption in the past, were even more particularly
prohibited. The only exceptions were for employees
and their families, the poor or unfortunate, and persons engaged
in religious or philanthropic work. In this connection, it may
be added that the law of 1910 somewhat modified this rule by
enlarging the meaning of "employees" to include caretakers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>milk and other commodities. It also dealt with the issuance
of franks by express, telegraph and telephone companies in
some detail. Superannuated or pensioned employees and the
bodies of persons killed in service might also be carried free.
Such details are significant as illustrating the extreme nicety
of definition required by the drastic character of the prohibitions.</p>

<p>An important change was also made by the law of 1906 in
re-imposing the penalty of imprisonment, as well as of fine, for
departure from the published tariff. Its removal from the
original law of 1887, in the interest of effective enforcement,
was recognized as a mistake. With the complete affirmance
by the courts of power to compel the production of evidence,
recalcitrant witnesses were now under control. It was hoped
that vigorous prosecution with this criminal punishment added,
might put an end to the abuse.</p>

<p>An entirely new feature was added to the law by the so-called
"Commodity Clause." This sought to divorce transportation
entirely from all other lines of business. The experience of
years had shown that corporations, especially in the coal-fields,
by combining both the service of carrier and shipper, might
most effectively stifle competition of independent producers.
Rank discrimination might be concealed by means of ingeniously
framed systems of inter-company accounts. And denial
of equal facilities such as cars or sidings might operate to drive
competitors out of the business. While the Hepburn law was
before Congress, several events drew attention forcibly to the
existence of such abuses. The Interstate Commerce Commission
in April, acting under the Tillman-Gillespie resolution,
uncovered flagrant violations of law on the Pennsylvania
system.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Equally important was the decision handed down in
February by the Supreme Court in the Chesapeake and Ohio
Railroad case.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> This dealt with discriminatory rates on soft
coal for the New Haven road, given by means of manipulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>of the pro-rating division between the various companies interested.
The general public was also greatly concerned over
the growth of monopoly in the anthracite fields and the coincident
rise in the price of coal. The independent producers
in the soft coal regions were at the same time roused over the
grievous discriminations practised against them, especially in
West Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Senator Elkins of that state,&mdash;usually a
strong railroad partisan,&mdash;introduced the amendment under
pressure from his constituents. It was warmly supported by
the most radical administration representatives. For it was
apparent at once that a withdrawal of railroads from all such
correlated businesses was not only proper in itself, but would
also greatly promote the enforcement of many other provisions
of the law. Yet the radical character of the proposition was
perhaps scarcely appreciated. Some railroads, like the Lackawanna,
were dependent for nearly three-fourths of their tonnage
upon the anthracite coal traffic; much of it from their
own mines. The Chesapeake and Ohio in the eastern fields
and the 'Frisco in the Middle West, relied upon soft coal for
more than half of their tonnage. A great many other carriers
were interested to a lesser degree. To compel them all to give
up their coal properties was indeed a serious matter.</p>

<p>The "commodity clause" provided that "after May 1, 1908,
it shall be unlawful for any railroad company to transport from
any state ... to any other state ... any article or commodity
other than timber and the manufactured products thereof,
manufactured, mined, or produced by it, or under its authority,
or which it may own in whole or in part, or in which it may have
any interest, direct or indirect, except such articles or commodities
as may be necessary and intended for its use in the conduct
of its business as a common carrier."</p>

<p>The original proposition was even more drastic. It was
to apply to all common carriers, such as the pipe lines in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
oil business. But it was soon considerably modified in the
course of passage.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> First, it was limited to railroads. Then
the western senators, on behalf of the lumber industry, secured
its special exception. And, finally, an attempt to prohibit
specifically the control of subsidiary industrial companies
through stock ownership was defeated. But, as thus limited,
the clause finally passed the Senate,&mdash;the stronghold of the
railroad interests,&mdash;by a vote of 67 to 6. This affords a good
indication of the extent of popular feeling on the subject. It
was fortunate indeed that the prohibition was not to take effect
for two years, in view of the litigation necessary for its precise
interpretation. For in any event it was bound to lead to much
corporate readjustment. The course of these proceedings will
be considered in the next chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There remains for consideration one of the most important
provisions of the Hepburn law, namely that dealing with
publicity of accounts.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Section twenty of the law of 1887
called for the filing by all carriers of annual reports with the
Interstate Commerce Commission. These reports were to be
standardized; and the Commission was empowered, in addition,
to demand specific information whenever it was so desired.
But the absence of express authority to enforce these orders,
except by means of tedious equity proceedings in the courts,
made improvements in accounting almost entirely dependent
upon the tact and resourcefulness of the statistician. The
Commission was most fortunate in the services of Prof. Henry
C. Adams, who succeeded in bringing about cordial co&ouml;peration
between the accounting officials of the railroads and the government.
Great improvements in the line of uniformity resulted;
but the need of positive control became increasingly apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span></p>

<p>Many officials were unwilling to certify by oath to the correctness
of their returns. With the increasing size of the roads,
it became more and more difficult to secure promptness. The
annual Statistics of Railways had almost to await the pleasure
of the carriers in filing their statements. And vitally important
information was often withheld. In the case of the Lake
Shore road, for example, which for years had charged all its
improvements to operating expenses, it positively declined to
state what portion of those improvements were permanent additions
to the property, properly chargeable to capital account,
and what were in the nature of renewals and repairs. And the
Supreme Court had found no authority in the law to compel
the furnishing of this information.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> With the growth of extended
systems of railroads, characterized by the most involved
methods of inter-corporate accounting, the need of precise data
became ever more imperative. Something more was evidently
necessary than a mere expression by Congress of an opinion
favorable to publicity. The mandatory provisions added in
1906 to the Twentieth Section are, therefore, vital, not only
in themselves; they are essential to the administrative enforcement
of nearly every other part of the regulative law. A determined
effort was made in 1908 to defeat the purpose of this
clause by restricting appropriations for carrying it into effect.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
But it emerged unscathed&mdash;thanks to President Roosevelt&mdash;and
stands today as one of the best features of the new
statute.</p>

<p>One may readily distinguish no less than five distinct and
important special services to be rendered by full publicity of
accounts. The earliest to be fully appreciated was its serviceableness
in securing equality of treatment of all shippers. In
the good old freebooters' days, rebates were probably openly
entered as such on the books. But with the need of concealment,
they came to be covered up in all sorts of ways; often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>times
under such guises, as in the notable Atchison case, in such
manner that not even the directors knew what they meant.
With full standardization of accounts, such abuses may readily
be detected and the offenders traced and punished. In the
second place, open standardization of the books makes strongly
for more efficient and honest operation.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The comparative
method in statistics may be readily applied; so that the
president of a railroad may have at command a complete
statement of operations in detail, which is comparable not
only with his own results in preceding years but with other
roads similarly circumstanced. The haphazard and unscientific
methods of operation in the British Isles are largely a
resultant of the absence of any logical and uniform system of
public accounts.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>Detailed cost keeping in the management of great systems
of inter-related railroads, being absolutely essential to efficiency,
makes also for honesty in operation. Such gross frauds as developed
upon the Illinois Central in 1910, variously estimated
to have cost the road from $2,500,000 to $5,000,000 through
overcharges for equipment repairs, might readily enough have
been detected under an efficient and honest management. This
instance immediately suggests a third advantage of full publicity
of accounts, namely the protection of investors. Flagrant
manipulation of maintenance accounts, "skinning" or "fattening"
roads in the interest of inside speculators, has always been
dependent upon secrecy. Assurance of a stable market for
railroad securities, based upon entire frankness as to the
degree to which these properties are being kept whole or
improved, is one of the prime advantages which may be
expected to flow from such governmental prescription of
accounts. And general public confidence in railway invest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>ments
cannot conceivably be better encouraged than by such
publicity. In no other detail than this, does the Act to
Regulate Commerce more directly benefit the general body
of stockholders in railroads, as well as the corporations
themselves.</p>

<p>The three foregoing advantages of publicity had been long
appreciated. These recent changes introduced in the Federal
law brought two others into special prominence. One is the
newly assumed responsibility by the government in the matter
of rate making. The other is its intervention in cases of dispute
between the carriers and their employees. In both cases
it is imperative that there should be available data for a just
determination of the issues at stake. There must be assurance
that every essential feature of the situation is fully and fairly
set forth upon the books. Otherwise, as in disputed rate cases,
every fact as to cost of service,&mdash;a primary basis of measurement,&mdash;is
vitiated. Absurd and misleading calculations may
be presented in evidence, which greatly hamper the government
in deciding the case.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> And now with the projected physical
valuation of properties as an element in rate making, all of the
factors of maintenance, betterment and depreciation, of joint
facilities, rentals and sinking funds must be taken into account.
In labor disputes, the same considerations apply.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Under the
requirements of the Erdman Act, every mediation,&mdash;and the
need for it is more frequent every year,&mdash;calls for critical
analysis by the chairman of the Commission and the Federal
commissioner of labor of the statements from both sides
as to the reasonableness of the action to be taken respecting
wages or conditions of employment.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> The notable arbitration
in 1912 is the most important instance as yet. Having
all of these services in mind, it seems likely that the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>ing
provisions added to the law in 1906 will be second to
none in bringing about the elimination of existing evils, and
in standardizing and improving operation, finance and traffic
practice.</p>

<p>Under the new law monthly and special as well as annual
reports, might be required under oath; with appropriate penalties
of fine and imprisonment for delay or mis-statement. All
accounts must be kept according to forms, general and detailed,
prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Such
rules applied of course to all carriers subject to the law, such as
express and sleeping-car companies, pipe lines and even water
carriers where operated in connection with railroads. Moreover,
the Commission was to have access to the books at all
times. For this purpose, it might employ special examiners.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
In other words, the system employed for years in connection
with the regulation of national banks, was now extended to the
interstate carriers. An additional safeguard was provided in
the clause which made it unlawful to keep any other accounts
books or memoranda than those approved; with the same
penalties for violation. In brief, the policy was now perfectly
definite. Carriers were rendered public service companies in
every sense of the word. Mere indefinite publicity was replaced
by specific regulation. This policy was not only clearly written
in the law; but the Commission in promulgating its orders
relative to accounting, laid upon every officer concerned, full
personal responsibility for the statements rendered. Minor
officials, made scapegoats for chief offenders, were no longer to
be tolerated. The relation between agent and principal was
clearly defined. It was assumed that so far as accounts were
concerned, such officials were representatives of the Commission
in carrying out the law. A new principle was introduced in
the regulation of carriers which could not fail to be productive
of great good. In this respect the Hepburn amendments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>granted all that the most ardent advocates of publicity
demanded.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A summary view of this important legislation,&mdash;in form
merely an amendment of the original law of 1887, but in
reality constituting an entirely new departure,&mdash;may now be
had. The gains for effective regulation were considerable.
Among them may be noted its enlarged field, the separation
of transportation from other businesses, elimination of the
iniquitous railroad passes, control over joint rates and pro-rating,
the expedition of judicial procedure, full publicity of
accounts, enhancement of the dignity and compensation of the
Commission, and, most important of all, the grant in so many
words of administrative rate-making power. The carriers&mdash;and
the administration also&mdash;failed to obtain the much-desired
repeal of the prohibition of pooling. On the other
hand, as against these gains for reform should be set the
following concessions to the railroads. Rate-making control
was still subject to broad court review. No one as yet knew
what this might bring forth. Maximum rates only might be
prescribed. And much as to the proper relativity of rates,
involved both in matters of freight classification and of
enforcement of the long and short haul clause, was left untouched.
Rate advances were still possible without determination
of their reasonableness in advance. Suspension of orders
pending judicial review, still remained. There was as yet
no control over physical operation, such as furnishing cars,
although switches might be ordered. Many of the states had
long since undertaken this work. And the great body of independent
carriers on our inland waters were still left beyond
the reach of the Federal law. In the main, the administration
had won a notable victory, although at some considerable cost.
The principle of effective regulation of public-service carriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
had been, indeed, vigorously affirmed in no mistakable terms.
But the task was not yet completed. Many details of law were
needed to "Clinch the Roosevelt policies." Nevertheless, it
was probably better that a brief experience with the new law,
both among the people and in the courts, should precede further
legislation. Great reforms should not be too suddenly effected,
else reaction is certain to take place. For the time being a
positive step forward had been taken.</p>

<p>The first direct effect of the new law was a great increase in
the volume of business of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Within two years over nine thousand appeals were made to it
in one form or another for the adjustment of transportation disputes.
The overwhelming majority of these complaints were
settled informally out of court; and in this work of conciliation
one of the most conspicuous and beneficial functions of the
new commission appears. But, nevertheless, an increasing
number of grievances seem to have required a formal hearing
and decision of record. Some indication of the public relief
sought is afforded by the fact that within approximately the
first two years and a half,&mdash;up to August 28, 1908,&mdash;1053
cases on the formal docket were disposed of, leaving over five
hundred issues still undecided. As compared with this total
of over fifteen hundred formal complaints under the new law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
the number filed under the old statute amounted to only 878
throughout the long period of eighteen years.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Moreover, the
number of complaints filed, steadily increased for several years.
The accompanying diagram well illustrates the great revival of
interest which took place. The two curves show respectively
the number of formal complaints by administrative years since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>1892, and the total of both formal and informal ones since 1903.
The sudden increase after the new law went into effect in 1906,
is, of course, presaged by some accession of business during
the preceding two years of public discussion. But the results
for the year 1907 first fully reflect the new conditions. From
65 formal complaints and 568 informal ones filed in 1905, the
numbers in each class rose within two years to 415 and 5,156,
respectively. It appears, however, that the climax was soon
attained. Since 1908, the number of formal complaints considerably
declined; and the informal ones seemed to be about
stationary in number. This was of course to be expected.
The accumulated grievances of past years had been largely
cared for. And the improved conditions brought about were
less productive of new sources of trouble.</p>

<p>Delay in settlement of claims for damages by shippers has
long been a great source of discontent. The Commission has
grappled with this problem vigorously. The following table
shows what has already been accomplished. The figures are
for administrative years, as covered by the annual reports to
Congress.</p>

<p>Here, again, it appears as if the maximum load had been reached,
so far as the Commission is concerned. Testimony of shippers
is emphatic upon this point.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> One railroad traffic manager
stated that the number of overcharge claims against his line,&mdash;one
of the most important in the country,&mdash;was twenty-five
per cent. less in 1909 than two years earlier; and that loss and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>damage claims were reduced approximately one-third. A very
large shipper compared his former "claims suspense account,"
sometimes amounting to $100,000, with $7,500 for 1909. The
number of such overcharge claims was 1,008 in 1905. For nine
months of 1909 it was 205. And yet these damages paid are
but a trifle, as compared with the aggregate of claim settlements
made by the roads directly. For the fiscal year to June 30, 1910,
such settlements made to shippers directly by steam roads
amounted to $21,941,232. How much of this sum was a legitimate
allowance for loss or damage incurred in transit, one
cannot discover. But it appears likely that an appreciable
fraction served as a cover for personal discrimination. Compulsory
reference to the government of all such claims would
speedily determine the true facts. In the meantime it is a
satisfaction to know that a competent tribunal now exists, to
which appeal with a minimum of expense may be made by
aggrieved shippers. Furthermore, it should also be noted in this
connection, that the situation as respects claims has been benefited
by a detail of the law of 1906, not heretofore mentioned.
The so-called Carmack amendment provided that carriers must
issue a through receipt or bill of lading, and thereby become
liable for the shipment throughout its entire journey; that is
to say, whether upon the initial road or a later connection.
The legal principles accepted in England since 1841 are thus
adopted. There is no doubt that great improvement in the
relation between the roads and the shipping public may be
anticipated as a result.</p>

<p>The great improvement in respect of standardization of rates,
evidenced primarily through reduction in the number of separate
tariffs issued by the railroads, has been elsewhere described<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> in
connection with classification. From 193,900 separate schedules
in 1906 to less than half that number five years later is a
notable achievement,&mdash;so notable indeed that it merits repetition
in this connection. The course of complaints, of claims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>and of new rates filed at Washington, affords cumulative
evidence of the great improvement in conditions which the new
legislation has brought about.</p>

<p>This activity of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it
is almost needless to mention, affords no true measure of the
benefits resulting from the law. Like every other sound piece
of legislation, it was intended to be preventive, not punitive.
The number of arrests by the police affords no indication of the
effectiveness of a criminal statute. Not the violations of law,
but the breaches forestalled, are of real significance. And
similarly in this instance, one surely finds the primary benefit
of legislation, not in the complaints preferred, but in the fact
that, under the improved relationship between the principals
concerned, many long-standing causes of irritation and misunderstanding
are being removed. The real gain, not to be
measured by figures, is to be found in the improved spirit of the
intercourse now prevalent between railway officials and their
customers. The shipper&mdash;especially if he be a small one&mdash;having
business to transact, may now be sure of courteous treatment
and a prompt and probably just outcome. In the old
days he was too often made to feel his utter economic dependence.
As a high traffic official recently put it: "One reason
we do not like this law is because we have to stop and think
twice what we are about. We must be ready to explain and
show a warrant for every act. An attack of indigestion cannot
any longer serve as an excuse for an arbitrary, off-hand ruling."
This improved spirit has permeated the whole staff of railway
officials who have seen a new light on the public aspect of their
calling.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>The nature of the complaints before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, with its amplified powers under the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
law, affords the best indication of the most important feature
of its work, namely the settlement of disputes between the railroads
and their clients.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> And it will be apparent that a large
number of these only indirectly raise the issue of the actual
freight rate. Oftentimes they concern rather the manner of
conducting business. An attentive perusal of these decisions
of the Commission offers interesting evidence of the range of a
carrier's activities. Every little station all over the country
between Aaron and Zuwash, and every conceivable commodity,
from "mole-traps in crates" to "jewelers' sweepings," is comprehended.
The fact that these disputes, often pecuniarily
insignificant, could not be amicably adjusted by the good offices
of the Commission informally, but necessitated formal hearing
and decision, is the strongest possible proof that some competent
tribunal of this sort was greatly needed in the interest of industrial
peace.</p>

<p>One of the commonest petty complaints is of misrouting of
freight. Goods are carried by a roundabout way, or by one not
enjoying the lowest through rate. Thus, to be specific, in 1908
six carloads of print-paper were shipped from Little Falls,
Minnesota, to Boise, Idaho.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Three routes were open, the rates
being respectively $1.30, $1.36, and $2.17 per hundred pounds.
The Northern Pacific road, in absence of instructions, sent the
goods by the third route,&mdash;presumably the one most profitable
to itself,&mdash;the result being a freight rate $1,760.62 greater
than it otherwise might have been. Reparation to this amount
was granted within three months by order of the Commission.</p>

<p>Another frequent difficulty concerns the supply of suitable
cars for the needs of the shipper. Carload rates are always
proportionately lower than charges for package shipment.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
The carriers very properly prescribe a certain minimum lading
as a requisite for the grant of these proportionately lower whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>sale
rates. The shipper at carload rates must, however, pay
for the full capacity of the car, whether his shipment fills it or
not. No exception can be taken to this practice, unless the
carrier is unable or unwilling to supply cars of a suitable size.
This sometimes happens. For instance, in 1908 a lumber-man
in Oregon, having a shipment of 39,500 pounds to make
to a point in Pennsylvania, requested of the Southern Pacific
a car of 40,000 pounds capacity.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> Not having one at hand, a
much larger car was furnished, having a minimum capacity
of 60,000 pounds. Following the standing rule as to carload
rates, the shipper was compelled to pay sixty-two and one-half
cents per hundred pounds on the marked capacity of the car,
that is to say, on 20,000 pounds more freight than he actually
shipped. This made a difference of $128.12 in the freight bill&mdash;nearly
fifty per cent. in excess of the charge based upon the
actual shipment. The Commission issued its order for reparation
within five weeks of the filing of the complaint.</p>

<p>A flagrant case of the misapplication of similar rules was
recently decided.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> A retail druggist at Douglas, North Dakota,
bought a sheet of plate glass eight feet square at St. Paul for
forty-six dollars. Usually such large sheets have to lie flat
on the car floor; and, occupying so much space, are properly
assessed at a minimum weight of five thousand pounds, regardless
of the actual lading. But in this instance the glass was
carried upright, screwed to the end of the car, along with a lot
of miscellaneous freight. Applying the standard rule made the
freight bill for a distance of 587 miles, $9.50 more than the
<i>entire cost</i> of the glass at St. Paul. It appears strange that
the carrier should have permitted so clear a case to come to a
formal hearing at all. Presumably it contested it as much for
the protection of its standard rules as for the sake of the
actual revenue involved. No exception can be taken to these
shipping rules as a whole; but these cases make it evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>that their application may be at times too harsh and rigid.
The tribunal established by the new law performs a much-needed
service to the community in tempering their application
in exceptional instances.</p>

<p>Attempts at arbitrary exclusion from participation in
through shipments, in order to stifle competition, not infrequently
crop out in these decisions. In 1905 the Enterprise
line, capitalized at four hundred thousand dollars, put three
steamers into commission from Fall River to New York.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> This
independent line was of the utmost importance to the cotton
manufacturers, as it was expected that at New York connection
could be made with competing rail and water lines to every part
of the United States. But all these lines, presumably at the
behest of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad,
which had hitherto enjoyed a monopoly of the business and
which, with its enormous tonnage of high-grade freight to be
parcelled out among connecting lines at New York, was a formidable
factor, promptly declined to join in making any through
rates. All their local rates from New York on, were, of course,
prohibitory. In one instance, while the through rate accorded
to the shipper over the New Haven road was sixteen and five-eighths
cents per hundredweight from New York on, the patron
of the Enterprise line was charged twenty-five and one-half
cents for the same service.</p>

<p>This case recalls a similar one in 1897, when the independent
Miami line of steamers from New York tried to break the
monopoly held by the steamship lines owned by the railroads
out of Galveston, Texas. The roads not only refused to pro-rate,
but actually demanded prepayment of freights from
Galveston on, as local rates. The Federal courts tinkered with
the subject for a while, until the Circuit Court of Appeals, while
recognizing a probable violation of law, affirmed that suit could
be legally instituted only by the United States.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Meantime,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>of course, the company was forced out of that business; and
rates have steadily risen ever since. In this later instance of
the Enterprise line, the Commission promptly ordered an extension
of the same privileges to the independent line that were
enjoyed by its powerful rival.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>The frequency of complaints as to the supply of equipment
needed for the regular operation of mills or mines, has already
been noted. There may be enough cars; but they may be supplied
too irregularly.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> And petitions for the issuance of through
rates or the opening of new routes became so common that a
substantial amplification of the law in 1910, as we shall see, was
effected in this regard. The carriers, of course, always prefer
in case of a choice of routes, to take the longest possible haul
over their own lines. This operates to close the more direct way.
The northern transcontinental lines got more revenue from
traffic which went east over their lines a thousand miles by way
of Spokane, than when it was turned over to a rival line at
Portland, Oregon, after a haul by them of only one hundred and
fifty miles.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Even in 1907, at the time of extreme congestion
of the Northern Pacific main line, when it was literally overwhelmed
with business, the lumbermen complained that they
could find no relief by these other routes.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Much the same
question was raised in another way in 1909, by a complaint
from growers and shippers of grain against the rate adjustment
which forced or attracted Kansas grain to the Kansas City market,
instead of permitting it to move on lower rates directly
from the point of origin to the Gulf ports for export, and to
Texas milling and consuming points.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> In this instance, however,
the shippers failed to make out a good case; so that the
complaint was dismissed.</p>

<p>No grievance is too petty to receive consideration. A peach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>canner
in Martinsdale, Georgia, is awarded reparation of $8.91
on a shipment of three cars of his wares.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> The sum of $11.84 is
awarded to a complainant for an overcharge on eleven rolls of
old worn-out canvas, assessed for freight rates as cotton goods
instead of junk, which it properly was.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Or in another case,
where a small boiler was shipped from Kalamazoo to Blue
Mounds, Michigan, on a combination of local rates, when it
was properly entitled to a joint through rate, an award of $6.87
to the shipper followed.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> It makes no difference whether the
welfare of a great territory or the smallest dealer is concerned.
It is all one to the government. The Hope Cotton Seed Oil
Company<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> in the South, shipped seventeen carloads of one
season's product in 1907 out over a certain road, on a low
through rate. The railroad agent was then informed that these
shipments interfered with the policy of establishing new industries
of this sort on another line; and the through rate was cancelled.
This jumped the charges from seventeen and one-half
cents per hundredweight to sixty-seven cents,&mdash;almost the
entire worth of the cotton-seed. Since the new law went into
effect, the Commission has prescribed a new rate of thirty cents;
and industrial peace is the result.</p>

<p>Thus has the work of this tribunal gone on, with its daily
grist of opinions on almost every conceivable phase of the
transportation business. It might be to prescribe that, even
though inflammable, small-lot shipments of petroleum must be
accepted by a carrier at least twice every week, instead of on
only one day; that structural iron might be stopped off <i>en route</i>
at Indianapolis,<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> as it is at Chicago and St. Louis, to be sheared,
fitted and punched, without losing the benefit of a low through
rate, just as cotton is halted at the compressor, or grain is milled
in transit; that a definite rate must be quoted on jewelers'
sweepings,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>&mdash;the dirt and waste laden with particles of gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>destined to the smelter,&mdash;even though it expose the carrier to
the risk of exorbitant claims for damage in case of accident;
that the railroad was properly entitled to charge storage after
six months on brewer's rice left on a wharf pending piecemeal
shipment to purchasers;<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> or that two different rates were contemporaneously
charged on nitrate of soda, according to
whether it was to be used in the manufacture of fertilizer or
gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> But whatever the issue, one has the satisfying
conviction, after reading the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> in the
decisions, not only that the matter has been settled by a
disinterested and supposedly impartial third party, but that
the decision is endowed with the beneficent force of public
authority. As one reads these decisions, there is no evidence
of political log-rolling, or of legal quibbling. They go straight
to the point on the economic and common-sense issues involved.
It is gratifying, moreover, to note occasionally that
the dispute has already been informally settled before the
Commission has time to render its opinion.</p>

<p>By no means are all these decisions in favor of the shipper.
In fact, during the first fourteen months, only forty-six out of
one hundred and seven formal cases were thus settled. The
railroads enjoy no monopoly of unfair practices. Indeed, many
of the rules, the exceptional application of which works hardship,
were originally provided to meet some attempt at fraud
by shippers. They might be under-classifying; seeking free
storage on wheels pending sale of their goods; claiming exorbitant
damages; or perpetrating any one of a thousand petty
meannesses to which human nature is liable. One or two instances
of shippers' complaints set aside as unreasonable may
not be out of place.</p>

<p>The Topeka banana dealers in 1908 complained that bananas
<i>en route</i> from New Orleans were subject to an appreciable
shrinkage in weight, amounting to about six hundred pounds
per car.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> Inasmuch as about fourteen thousand cars were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>being moved annually, it is clear that the aggregate loss of
weight was considerable. The practice had been to weigh the
bananas when transferred from the steamers at New Orleans
to the cars, and to levy the freight rate upon this weight. To
this the dealers objected, instancing among other things the
practice, long prevalent in the cattle business where a similar
loss of weight in transit occurs, of charging according to the
weight of the shipments, not at the initial point, but at the
point of delivery. At first sight the complaint appears to be
well founded. Surely one should not be compelled to pay
freight on a greater lading than is carried. But the Commission
on examination decided in favor of the roads. It was shown
that the service was most exceptional as to the shipment,
handling and speed; and it was held that the charges were on
the whole reasonable and just.</p>

<p>One of the most important issues in which the railroads have
won their contention concerned the loading of lumber on
flat cars.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> For half a century the practice has been that the
shipper should provide his own lumber-stakes and pay freight
on them as on the lumber itself. In 1905 the National Lumbermen's
Association tried to change all this, and to impose upon
the carriers the legal duty of securing the loads in place as they
do with many other commodities. The carriers offered a compromise,
agreeing to allow five hundred pounds per car free for
the weight of the stakes; but refused to accept responsibility
for safely stowing the goods. The Commission, finally, after
prolonged inquiry by experts, relieved the carriers of this care
and expense.</p>

<p>It is undeniable also that the carriers have found solace in
certain unforeseen ways under the amended law. The rigid
prohibition of all favors and rebates has substantially raised
the general level of charges, so general was the practice of cutting
rates a few years ago. To be sure, this increase has affected
principally the large shippers, thus tending to equalize opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
between all grades of competitors. But over and above
this, the prohibition of any act tainted with favoritism has enabled
the carriers successfully to withstand many leakages of
revenue. Claims for damages can be plausibly denied on the
ground that their settlement might arouse suspicion, and possibly
lead to prosecution for the grant of individual favors.
Many roads have also actually augmented their revenues by
this same line of argument. The custom of charging a merely
nominal rental of one dollar for freight-sheds, other buildings
or land used for side-tracks or elevators, was formerly general.
It would have been awkward to place these contracts on a
strictly commercial basis, especially where the tenants were
shippers with the option of resorting to a rival line. But on
the plea that a continuance of these nominal rentals might be
considered a criminal act of favoritism, substantial increases of
revenue have been obtained. On one road alone over three
thousand of these nominal rentals have been raised to strictly
commercial figures. The aggregate increase of revenue from
this source has been by no means inconsiderable.</p>

<p>A very important group of cases brought before the Interstate
Commerce Commission under the new law concerned the
reasonableness of the various freight-rate advances which were
occurring all along the line.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> This raised a question as to the
absolute fairness of the new rates as against the interest of the
general public. One conclusion is certain. The new law did
not prevent the carriers from persisting in a policy, adopted
nearly ten years earlier, after a generation of steadily declining
rates, of quite generally putting up their charges. Unfortunately,
the law of 1906 was defective in making no provision for
dealing adequately with such cases. The Interstate Commerce
Commission was limited in its scope to the consideration only
of specific complaints. It could not on its own initiative pass
upon the reasonableness of an entire new schedule of rates in
advance of its taking effect. It must take the matter up, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>at all, bit by bit, as individual shippers chanced to complain,
after the rates have become operative. This abridgment of
its power to pass upon the reasonableness of tariffs as a whole
was effected in the Senate. It was not contemplated either by
President Roosevelt or by the House of Representatives. The
result, as predicted, was that little protection was afforded to
the public in any large way. Judging by results, the railroads
were as free as they ever were, to increase their tariffs whenever
they saw fit so to do.</p>

<p>The imperative need of amending the law, and of granting
power to suspend such rate advances, not merely in particular
cases on complaint, but as to entire schedules of rates prior to
their taking effect, was in fact met by the next set of amendments
in 1910. The experience of the intervening years amply
proved the need of some such amendment.</p>

<p>The extent of the changes after the new law went into effect
may be indicated by a few typical instances. Few commodities
are of greater importance to the United States than chemical
fertilizers, used in enormous quantities all over the country.
The basis of these is phosphate rock. The freight rate on this
from Tennessee to Chicago in 1907 was $3.40 per ton. It was
increased to $3.95, until the Commission ordered its reduction
to the old figure.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> At the same time the Oregon lumbermen
had their rates to the East increased about one quarter, after
a period of quiescence of six years. From the Willamette
valley to San Francisco&mdash;a test case soon to run a long course
before the courts<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>&mdash;lumber rates were $3.10. In 1907 they
were put up to five dollars. The Commission held that $3.40
was an adequate rate. The last general increase had occurred
in January, 1909, particularly in transcontinental rates, where
the fruit of the Harriman monopoly made itself felt. Not
unduly great in the East, considering the increased cost of
operation,&mdash;twenty-five cents per ton on pig iron and iron pipe,
for instance,&mdash;the Pacific Coast rates from New York rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>often as high as fifty per cent. The rate on dry goods went up
by one-third. Therein lay a part of the motive power for
Union Pacific speculative finance.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Among the most persistently
contested schedules was that concerning rates from the
southwestern cattle ranges to the markets of the Middle West.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
In 1897 the rate on steers was twenty-seven cents per hundredweight.
Step by step it went up to the level of thirty-six and
one-half cents in 1903,&mdash;a rise of more than one-third within
six years.</p>

<p>Occasionally one strikes an exorbitant rise in the East, however,
as in one instance where on imported iron pyrites used
in making sulphuric acid, the rate, which in 1903 was $1.56,
became $2.72 four years later.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> And the hardship often lay
in the fact that these increases were most marked in the case
of the small shipper,&mdash;the very one who, in these days of large
enterprises, we can least afford to spare. The rate on cotton
goods from the South to the Pacific Coast rose only fifteen per
cent, between 1896 and 1907 by the carload; for smaller lots
it rose sixty-five per cent.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> In 1907, 38,000,000 pounds of cheese
were produced in southwestern Wisconsin. The shipper to
Chicago by carload paid only about ten per cent, more in 1907
than eight years earlier; but the shipper in smaller lots was
compelled to pay forty per cent. more.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> As always, the change
was along the line of least resistance. Such a policy made for
larger dividends; but did it tend to the perpetuation of equality
of opportunity as between great and small concerns? That
was a social question of the very first importance, which had
much to do with the demand for still further increase of the
regulative power of the Federal government in 1910.</p>

<p>Under the new powers conferred by law, it was now possible
to investigate scientifically many matters which heretofore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>had been privately governed by rule of thumb. For instance
the reasonableness of the charges for refrigeration in the movement
of citrus fruit is dependent in practice upon the methods
employed in gathering and packing them for market.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Was it
better business practice to ship oranges and lemons in ice-cooled
refrigerator cars, or was it better to adopt the so-called
pre-cooling process, combined with great care in handling?
The former was the long-standing practice of the fruit-growers,
while the latter, substantially supported by the investment of
more than a million dollars in plant, was advocated by the carriers.
One had been tested in practice, the other was yet in
the experimental stage. But aside from rivalry of method,
were not the shippers entitled to pre-cool or refrigerate their
fruit privately if they so desired? The determination of this
question meant an elaborate investigation with careful records
in detail as to the results obtained in either case. The decision
upheld the carriers in their charges for the older methods of
treatment; but pre-cooling charges had to be reduced by
seventy-five per cent. It appears, therefore, that authority
to deal with one of the most serious grievances voiced before
the Elkins Committee in 1905, may now be fairly and
scientifically exercised for the public benefit.</p>

<p>A similar technical investigation concerned the methods of
transporting the products of "creameries."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Shall dairy products
be centralized at favored points, possessed of a sufficient
supply from the surrounding territory to permit of large-scale
manufacture; or shall the older local creamery method prevail,
whereby the product is taken directly from country stations
to the great centres of consumption like Chicago? The particular
rate adjustment makes all the difference between creameries
scattered throughout the countryside or, on the other
hand, located in the great cities. One of the prime difficulties
is in the sparsity and uneven distribution of the cow population.
Here was an order requiring a very careful investigation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>entire business, followed by a nice judgment as to the economic
merits of the case. The history and development of the dairy
business in the West had to be thoroughly looked into. Quite
irrespective of the resulting order, it is apparent that the public
is certain to benefit from an exhaustive inquiry. Yet other
general investigations of the same sort might be cited to the
same end. The wool business was examined thoroughly in
1911.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The entire New England rate system as well as the
conditions of operation were overhauled in the following year,
and a general inquiry into the hard coal situation is just now
under way. A general improvement of conditions is bound to
flow from the free exercise of such general powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The leading Supreme Court decision construing the Hepburn
law,&mdash;and, constitutionally, one of the most important
in recent years,&mdash;was rendered in 1910 with reference to the
relation between the exercise of power over transportation by
the Interstate Commerce Commission and the right of review
of such action by the courts.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> The details of the controversy
are indicative of the nicety of economic adjustment required
in such cases. There was a shortage of equipment for the
carriage of soft coal on the lines of the Illinois Central Railroad.
This commodity, practically speaking; cannot be stored. It
must be disposed of at once, so that the available supply of
cars determines the output of each mine. If, in this case, all
the cars had belonged to the Illinois Central Railroad to be used
indiscriminately by the mine owners, it would have been a
simple matter to have allotted the equipment among all the
operators along its lines upon the basis of the established capacity
of each. Unfortunately, diversity of ownership of these
cars had brought about, all over the country, special rules for
effecting the allotments. Some cars belonged to the railroad;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>others to the mine company, to other private parties, or to
foreign railways. Certain railroads first deducted all fuel
carried by other equipment than their own from the estimated
capacity of each mine, and then divided up their own available
cars <i>pro rata</i> among all the mines according to the net capacity
thus fixed. Others allotted their cars according to the gross
mine capacity, taking no account of the private or outside
equipment which any particular coal mine possessed or might
obtain. This second practice evidently favored the larger concerns,
supplied with abundant capital for investment in cars or
for renting equipment. For, in addition to their own cars,
they could still demand as many more from the railroad on
daily allotment as if they were entirely dependent upon it for
the movement of all their coal. Which was the fairer practice?
A nice economic question was thus raised. Has a shipper the
right to exclusive use of all his own fuel cars, and, in addition
thereto, a full share of the system cars of the railroad? Disputes
of this sort have been before the Commission and the
courts for years.</p>

<p>In this Illinois Central case, a colliery company complained
of even a more minute detail of the rule employed by the railroad
in making its daily allotment, affirming it to be discriminatory
in effect. There was a shortage of cars and of coal. The
railroad was employing many of its own cars in the special
service of carrying fuel for its own use. The particular grievance
was its insistence upon treating these special Illinois
Central cars, for the purposes of allotment, as if they were
merely ordinary private cars; that is to say, by supplying them
in practice regardless of and outside of the daily allotment,
otherwise agreed upon. It thus appears that the economic
issue was highly technical in character. Similar complaints
had been already variously decided by other tribunals. The
Commission, moreover, was bound to consider this complaint
with several others of a like sort. Exercising its best business
judgment under all the circumstances, it decided against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
practice, ordering the Illinois Central, under the powers conferred
by the new law of 1906, to include all cars, however
owned or for whatever purpose used, in figuring its daily allotments
in time of shortage of equipment. The case went to the
Supreme Court upon petition of the railroad to set aside the
order of the Commission.</p>

<p>By contrast with the economic intricacy of this case, the
fundamental legal question was simple. How broad was the
right of review of the Commission's order, as conferred by
the amendments adopted in 1906? Were the courts to rest
content merely to pass upon the regularity and lawfulness of
the forms of procedure adopted by the Commission, or might
they go further, and, hearing all the evidence as to fact, proceed
to settle the economic controversy as well as the law
points, in entire independence of the Commission? In the
former case administrative control would result. In the latter,
regulative power would really reside in the judicial branch of
the government. It was the same old controversy which by
adoption of the second alternative had practically emasculated
the law of 1887, and had necessitated its amplification by
amendment in 1906.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> A momentous issue was presented. To
go forward would make for logical definition and separation of
the powers of the Federal government; to retreat would be to
precipitate anew the inevitable conflict in Congress, from
which, it was hoped, we had emerged for good!</p>

<p>The importance of the Illinois Central decision is such that
the conclusion should be stated by direct quotation, with our
italics as to the main point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Beyond controversy, in determining whether an order of the
Commission shall be suspended or set aside, we must consider, <i>a</i>, all
relevant questions of constitutional power or right; <i>b</i>, all pertinent
questions as to whether the administrative order is within the scope of
the delegated authority under which it purports to have been made;
and, <i>c</i>, a proposition which we state independently, although in its
essence it may be contained in the previous one, viz., whether, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>although the order be in form within the delegated power, nevertheless
it must be treated as not embraced therein, because the exertion of
authority which is questioned has been manifested in such an unreasonable
manner as to cause it, in truth, to be within the elementary rule
that the substance, and not the shadow, determines the validity of the
exercise of the power. <i>Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams</i>, 155 U. S.,
688, 698. Plain as it is that the powers just stated are of the essence
of judicial authority, and which, therefore, may not be curtailed, and
whose discharge may not be by us in a proper case avoided,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> <i>it is equally
plain that such perennial powers lend no support whatever to the proposition
that we may, under the guise of exerting judicial power, usurp merely
administrative functions by setting aside a lawful administrative order
upon our conception as to whether the administrative power has been wisely
exercised. Power to make the order and not the mere expediency or wisdom
of having made it, is the question.</i>"</p></div>

<p>On this cogent reasoning the Supreme Court, therefore,
quite independently of its opinion upon the economic merits,
declined to permit interference with the order of the
Commission.</p>

<p>Immediately following the Illinois Central decision another
was rendered concerning somewhat the same economic issue,
namely methods of supplying coal cars on the Baltimore and
Ohio.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The following quotation is significant of what promises
to be the line of reasoning in future.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In ... the ... case just decided, it was pointed out that the effect
of the section was to cause it to come to pass that courts, in determining
whether an order of the Commission should be suspended or enjoined,
were without power to invade the administrative functions vested in
the Commission, and, therefore, could not set aside an order duly
made on a mere exercise of judgment as to its wisdom or expediency.
Under these circumstances it is apparent, as we have said, that these
amendments of 1906 add to the cogency of the reasoning which led
to the conclusion in the Abilene Case, that the primary interference
of the courts with the administrative functions of the Commission was
wholly incompatible with the act to regulate commerce. This result
is easily illustrated. A particular regulation of a carrier engaged in
interstate commerce is assailed in the courts as unjustly preferential
and discriminatory. Upon the facts found, the complaint is declared
to be well founded. The administrative powers of the Commission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>are invoked concerning a regulation of like character upon a similar
complaint. The Commission finds, from the evidence before it, that
the regulation is not unjustly discriminatory. Which would prevail?
If both, then discrimination and preference would result from the very
prevalence of the two methods of procedure. If, on the contrary, the
Commission was bound to follow the previous action of the courts,
then it is apparent that its power to perform its administrative functions
would be curtailed, if not destroyed. On the other hand, if the
action of the Commission were to prevail, then the function exercised
by the court would not have been judicial in character, since its final
conclusion would be susceptible of being set aside by the action of a
mere administrative body. That these illustrations are not imaginary
is established not only by this record, but by the record in the case
of the <i>Illinois C. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission</i>."</p></div>

<p>These opinions, expressly recognizing the constitutionality
of the free and full exercise of legislative power delegated by
Congress beyond the power of the courts to review, are of fundamental
importance. Had they been rendered a few days earlier,
as we shall see, they might have prevented the supposed necessity
of setting up a new commerce court by law in 1910. They
would certainly have abridged the Congressional debates over
points of law. Under these decisions, only authority and constitutional
rights may be reviewed. The same issues were
raised in the Portland Gateway opinion in 1910, soon to engage
our attention, concerning the Commission's right to designate
through routes for passenger travel. Over-ruling the Commission
in this instance, however, the narrow right of review by
the courts, as laid down in the Illinois Central case, is somewhat
widened by an apparent refusal to treat the Commission's
findings as to fact as conclusive in determining its jurisdiction;
however conclusive it may regard them in other respects. A
shady byway of judicial encroachment is thus rather surreptitiously
indicated.</p>

<p>A more satisfactory re-affirmation of the disposition of the
Supreme Court to allow a wide field and a free hand to the
Commission in the exercise of its offices, is to be found in a
third opinion, the so-called Burnham, Hanna, Munger case, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
rendered in 1910.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Certain Missouri river cities complained
that rates from the Atlantic seaboard were unduly high by comparison
with those to cities in Central Traffic territory, namely
between the Mississippi river and Buffalo. The Commission
held the complaint well founded; and ordered a readjustment,
by reduction of that portion of the rate west of the Mississippi.
Thus, by leaving the rates to the Central Traffic Association
cities unchanged, it materially benefited those along the Missouri
river by comparison. Omaha and Kansas City were brought
substantially closer to the seaboard as compared with Chicago
and similar trade centres. The western roads, alone affected
by this order, attacked it in the courts as an assertion by the
Commission of power "artificially to apportion out the country
into zones tributary to given trade centres to be pre-determined
by the Commission, and non-tributary to others." The Supreme
Court, in upholding the order, held that it would indeed be an
abuse of power to raise or lower rates for the sole purpose above-outlined.
Nevertheless, if the Commission were seeking primarily
to correct rates inherently unreasonable, such action would
not be invalidated by incidental effects upon trade conditions.
The Supreme Court found, therefore, that the order in question
was within its power, as thus defined, and, governed by the
reasoning in the Illinois Central case, held that the Commission's
decision could not be judicially reviewed upon the merits.</p>

<p>The line of judicial interpretation preceding the Mann-Elkins
law of 1910 has been even more rigidly followed by the
Supreme Court since that time. The most important decision,
perhaps, was rendered in 1912. This concerned the absolute
reasonableness of rates on fir lumber from the northern Pacific
forests to the Middle West.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> But it involved the additional
consideration that the transcontinental roads had in a measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>guaranteed an economic status to lumbermen under which they
had made large investments, which, as they claimed, were
jeopardized by an increase of freight rates in 1907. Two points
were raised. One concerned the reasonableness of the new
rates <i>per se</i>; the other their reasonableness in the light of their
effects upon an established yet dependent industry. It was the
old issue, in brief, between cost of service and value of service.
A decision upon the latter basis alone might have resulted, as
in a similar action, in the Burnham, Hanna, Munger case, just
outlined, in decreeing an extension of authority over commerce
by the Commission. Fortunately the court found otherwise
in these lumber cases. It was able to uphold the order of the
Commission, without deviation from the path of reasoning
laid down in the Illinois Central opinion. The decision
concludes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Considering the case as a whole, we cannot say that the order was
made because of the effect of the advance on the lumber industry, nor
because of a mistake of law as to presumptions arising from the long
continuance of the low rate when the carrier was earning dividends, nor
that there was no evidence to support the finding. If so, the Commission
acted within its power, and, in view of the statute, its lawful
orders cannot be enjoined."</p></div>

<p>The unsatisfactory element in this decision is its implication
that the Commission must be governed by cost of service principles
in fixing reasonable rates. For to admit the plea of the
lumbermen, that their industry could not stand the increase,
would obviously lend an ear to the principle of value of service.
May the railroads properly adopt either of the two principles
in fixing their tariffs, while the Commission is confined to cost
of service alone? Any such conclusion would tend to paralyze
regulation. And Congress would certainly in a moment fly
to the rescue with amplification of the statute.</p>

<p>This Pacific coast lumber opinion also contains the following
succinct statement of the grounds upon which alone the Federal
courts may review the orders of the Commission:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There has been no attempt to make an exhaustive statement of
the principle involved, but in cases thus far decided, it has been settled
that the orders of the Commission are final unless (1) beyond the power
which it could constitutionally exercise; or (2) beyond its statutory
power; or (3) based upon a mistake of law. But questions of fact
may be involved in the determination of questions of law, so that an
order, regular on its face, may be set aside if it appears that (4) the
rate is so low as to be confiscatory and in violation of the constitutional
prohibition against taking property without due process of law; or
(5) if the Commission acted so arbitrarily and unjustly as to fix rates
contrary to evidence, or without evidence to support it; or (6) if the
authority therein involved has been exercised in such an unreasonable
manner as to cause it to be within the elementary rule that the substance,
and not the shadow, determines the validity of the exercise
of the power."</p></div>

<p>Quite like the preceding case was another concerning the
reasonableness of advances of rates upon fir lumber from the
Willamette valley to San Francisco. The Commission had
ordered a reduced rate, from which the Southern Pacific appealed
to the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> This tribunal set aside the order on
the ground that, while seeking to protect an investment in
lumber mills, it had not been governed by considerations as to
the intrinsic reasonableness of the rates. The lumbermen then
went back to the Commission with a new complaint, in response
to which a slight advance was permitted to the railroad, apparently
as a token of compliance with the opinion of the
Supreme Court. But the Southern Pacific, not yet content,
promptly appealed a second time under the Mann-Elkins law
to the new Commerce Court. On June 4, 1912, this tribunal
fully sustained the Commission in a most suggestive declaration
of the obligation of a carrier, having once induced capital to
embark in a new enterprise under promise of low rates, being
subsequently estopped from charging to the full limit of what
the traffic will bear.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> This is a gratifying evidence of acquiescence
of this new tribunal in the main line of interpretation
laid down by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span></p>

<p>Federal decisions construing the law of 1906 during this
period under review, revealed various shortcomings and defects
which could be repaired only by additional legislation. They
are to be considered among the causes contributing to the
passage of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, shortly to engage our
attention. Two in particular, the Orange Routing case and the
Portland Gateway order, merit discussion. Neither directly
involved monetary considerations, but a conflict between the
rights of shippers and carriers. And both alike went on appeal
to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<p>The Orange Routing case against the Southern Pacific
Railroad touched the right of the shipper to name the particular
railways over which his fruit should reach Eastern markets.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
Rates were the same by whatever route; but the railways
denied the right of the shipper not only to name, but even to
know, the route taken by his goods in transit. The same issue
came up some years ago, concerning the right of cotton shippers
at Memphis to designate the particular connecting railroads
which should haul their goods. The purpose of the carriers in
seeking to control this matter is obvious, and may be praiseworthy.
Secret rebates cannot often be secured by shippers
from the initial carriers, especially if, as in California, no railway
competition exists. For the Atchison and the Southern Pacific
have done away with that by pooling their fruit business.
Secret rebates, if secured by shippers at all, must be wrung from
the connecting lines, which bid for it at the great junction points,
like Kansas City and Chicago. The initial road, by reserving
the right to route the freight, is able most effectively to nullify
all such pernicious contracts. But, on the other hand, this
practice denies to the owner of the goods, control, or even supervision,
over his own. Market conditions may easily change
while the goods are in transit. It may be desirable to stop them
off at Chicago, or divert them to New Orleans. And, moreover,
damages for delay on such perishable goods as fruit are refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>by the terms of the contract. The routing road exercises power
without assuming responsibility. On these grounds, and in
consonance with the long-established principles of common
law, the Interstate Commerce Commission held that the shippers'
rights were jeopardized. It was shown that freight was
often diverted from one road to another in order to secure more
valuable percentages of the through rate for the initial carrier.
The Circuit Court in September, 1904, provisionally sustained
the Commission; but its opinion was reversed by the Supreme
Court in 1906. The court of last resort failed to find in the
law any prohibition of such regulations concerning routes by
the railroads. Incidentally it held that the Federal courts
might enforce orders of the Commission, even although for
reasons differing from those which governed the original order.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>The Portland Gateway case in 1910, before the Supreme
Court,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> also disclosed a defect in the law of 1906. It dealt with
the right of the Commission to designate through passenger
routes. Seattle, Washington, may be reached from the Middle
West either by various lines to St. Paul and from thence due
west by the "Hill lines," or by various railroads to Kansas City
and thence by the Burlington and the Northern Pacific, also
"Hill lines." There are also many routes first proceeding westward
<i>via</i> the Union Pacific to Portland, Oregon, and from thence
up to Seattle. By these latter routes most of the journey would
be over the "Harriman lines," whereas by the former it would
be by way of their competitors for the control of the northwest.
Passengers all the way over the "Hill lines" were afforded every
facility for through travel in the way of tickets and baggage;
but if they chose the Portland route, great inconvenience followed
from the refusal of the Hill lines to co&ouml;perate in facilities at the
transfer point. In brief the "Hill lines" were working for the
long haul over their own rails, as against the merely local haul
from Portland to Seattle, which would follow the choice of the
Harriman route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commission upon its own motion investigated this
situation, and, as a result, ordered the Northern Pacific to join
with its rivals in establishing through routes <i>via</i> Portland to
Seattle. This was done under authority in the law of 1906 to
establish through routes and joint rates, provided "no reasonable
or satisfactory through route exists." The Northern
Pacific claimed, and was upheld therein by a dissenting opinion
from the Commission, that there was already in existence such
a route. Quick and comfortable travel <i>via</i> St. Paul already
existed. Some eight thousand persons annually for one reason
or another preferred, nevertheless, to go through Portland.
The Commission held that this preference was reasonable, and
that accordingly, with respect to such travellers, there was indeed
no reasonable through route in effect. Passenger traffic,
involving the element of personal choice, in other words, was
different in law from freight business. The Circuit Court set
aside this order upon the ground that a satisfactory alternative
route over the Northern Pacific did actually exist. This decree
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in
1910. But it was a hard-won victory for the carriers, inasmuch
as Congress within six months specifically authorized the Commission
to regulate such matters in future, without limitation
as to the existence of other satisfactory routes.</p>

<p>The bitter rivalry between the Hill and Harriman systems
for the control of the Northwest, as affecting the routing of
freight traffic as well as of passengers through Portland, resulted
in carrying a second case of the same sort before the Supreme
Court. May temporary delay and congestion of business by
way of any given line afford the Commission authority to designate
another through route! In this instance, the Supreme
Court has affirmed the order of the Commission.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> It would
appear, therefore, that this issue, for the present at least, is
closed. The regulative power of the Federal government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>over routes and the division of joint rates is satisfactorily
upheld.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several Supreme Court decisions defining the power of the
Commission to require testimony, both oral and documentary,
in relation to matters which came before it, were rendered about
this time. Its prestige and authority in this regard,&mdash;already
affirmed in the late nineties,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>&mdash;were considerably enhanced by
an opinion delivered in April, 1904.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> In the course of the proceedings,
upon complaint of William R. Hearst against the
Reading and other coal roads, certain contracts between the
Lehigh Valley Coal Company and independent operators were
called for. One Baird and others, including President Baer
of the Reading company, declined to produce these coal purchase
contracts. Others refused to testify concerning methods
of fixing the price for anthracite coal at tidewater. Disregarding
certain purely legal details, these refusals were based upon
the contention that neither the Commission nor Hearst,&mdash;a
well-known owner of various newspapers,&mdash;had shown any
legal interest in the complaint. The court held, however, that
the want of direct damage to the complainant was not essential
to his standing before the Commission. Moreover, in this case,
the Supreme Court overruled the Federal Circuit Court, which
had held that the details of the contracts for purchase of coal
by railroads from independent operators related wholly to intrastate
transactions,&mdash;that, in other words, the selling of coal in
Pennsylvania had nothing to do with interstate commerce.
The Supreme Court adjudged that all the details of these transactions
had a bearing upon the general question of the degree
of monopoly in the coal business, and could not properly be
withheld from examination as evidence by the Commission. In
conclusion the court said: "To unreasonably hamper the Commission
by narrowing its field of inquiry beyond the requirements
of the due protection of rights of citizens, will be to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>seriously impair its usefulness and prevent a realization of the
salutary purposes for which it was established by Congress."
This sweeping decision by the court of last resort well buttressed
the former decisions of that tribunal in the Brimson and Brown
cases.</p>

<p>The so-called "Immunity Bath" Federal Court decision in
1906 materially affected, not so much the scope of authority of
the Commission as its mode of procedure in eliciting testimony
in railroad cases.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> A resolution of the House of Representatives
in 1904 had directed the Commissioner of Corporations to
conduct an investigation into the affairs of the so-called "Beef
Trust." In the course of this inquiry, Federal officials from the
bureau held interviews in Chicago with prominent members of
the beef-packing establishments. Important evidence was
obtained, with the understanding that this was merely a general
investigation having no relation to the Department of Justice,
nor intended to be used in the prosecution of any suits at law.
At the same time, agents examined the books of these companies.
The accountants, however, in all cases refused to certify
to their accuracy under oath. The material thus secured was
incorporated in a report of the bureau in the following year.
Not long afterward, when the prosecution of this combination
was undertaken by the Department of Justice, the attorneys for
the government made use of data in this report of the Bureau
of Corporations in presenting their case. Consequently, on
behalf of the packers under indictment under the provisions of
the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, it was urged that the interdictions
of this law were inoperative as to them, inasmuch as they had
virtually been made to testify against themselves. The District
court affirmed this immunity from prosecution under the
provision of the Constitution forbidding any person from being
compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span></p>

<p>The direct bearing of this decision upon subsequent prosecutions
for rebating, as in the notable Chicago and Alton case
in the following year, is apparent. No general investigation
of any subject, evidently, could be undertaken either by Congress
or the Interstate Commerce Commission, in the course
of which testimony had been elicited under pressure, if it was
intended that criminal prosecution by the Department of
Justice was subsequently to take place. The eagerness of
witnesses to secure the privileges of the "Immunity Bath"
by frank avowal of material facts might otherwise thwart
the government in the pursuance of its ends.</p>

<p>Another important decision of the Supreme Court touching
the right of the Commission to compel testimony was rendered
in 1908 in connection with the investigation of the Union Pacific
system.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Mr. Harriman, the dominant factor in the management
of this system, had caused the Union Pacific to purchase
certain stocks of the Atchison and a number of other railroads
in different parts of the country. The purchase price being
known, the witness was asked whether he had a personal interest
in the securities thus acquired by the road under his control.
He declined to answer, on the ground that the power to require
testimony was limited to the only cases where the sacrifice of
privacy was necessary, namely those where the investigation
concerned a specific breach of the law. The court, with three
justices dissenting, sustained Harriman in his refusal, on the
ground that this particular investigation was undertaken, not
in pursuance of a complaint of specific violation of the law, but
merely for the sake of general information as to the manner and
method in which the business of common carriers was being
conducted. No question was raised as to the right of the Commission
to undertake general investigations of this sort; it was
merely held that in the course of such investigations there was
a limit to the inquisitorial power of this administrative body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be added in this connection that the amendments added
by the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910 most specifically defined the
authority of the Commission in this regard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The "commodity clause" of the Hepburn amendments to
the Interstate Commerce Law, because of its unfortunate
ambiguity, has already twice been before the Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
The first interpretation was given in a decision concerning the
Delaware and Hudson Railroad, handed down in May, 1909.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>
This affirmed the constitutionality of the statute at all points;
but, at the same time, emasculated it most effectually. For,
in order to harmonize the opinion with prior ones holding that
ownership of stock in a corporation did not constitute legal
ownership of the property of the company, it was necessarily
held that a railroad by owning the share capital of a coal company
did not thereby possess an interest, direct or indirect, in
the coal mined. Moreover, a railroad which was the legal owner
of coal at the mine might escape the interdiction of the law by
selling the coal before transportation began. A handy means
of evading the intent of the law could not have been more
plainly indicated.</p>

<p>An attempt specifically to prohibit stock ownership in coal
mines by railroads,&mdash;thus meeting in part the situation arising
out of the foregoing decision,&mdash;was made in connection with
the Mann-Elkins Act in 1910; but to no avail. The Senate,
by a vote of twenty-five to thirty-one, rejected an amendment
proposed by Senator Bailey of Texas, to prohibit stock ownership
so clearly "that not even a judge of the Supreme Court
could fail to understand it." The negative votes were all cast
by the so-called "regular" Republicans. In the meantime, the
clause had been carried to the Supreme Court for further interpretation
in a suit against the Lehigh Valley Railroad.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>government in the lower court had already been defeated in an
attempt to raise questions of fact as to the pecuniary interest
of the road in the coal transported, irrespective of the technicalities
as to legal ownership. The outcome in this case was more
satisfactory. The Circuit Court was held to have erred in
ruling out these considerations. It was unanimously decided
by the Supreme Court that it was in violation of the law to use
stock ownership for the purpose of destroying the entity of a
producing corporation, while still so "commingling" its affairs
in administration with the affairs of the railroad as to make the
two corporations virtually one. This was a distinct gain for
the government. It necessitated a compliance with the law in
good faith. Upon the basis of this decision the Department of
Justice instituted a new action against the Lehigh Valley Road,
which was promptly met, however, by a readjustment of its
corporate affairs.</p>

<p>The economic results under the "commodity clause" have
been quite different from those doubtless anticipated by Congress.
A salutary separation of coal mining from transportation
is being effected; but in the case of the anthracite properties
at least, in such manner as to hold out small hope of any direct
benefit to the general public.</p>

<p>Absolute alienation of their coal properties by the railroads
was subject to two difficulties. Some roads, like the Reading
and the Lehigh Valley, had heavy issues of bonds outstanding,
based upon the security, jointly, of both the railroad and the
coal properties. The two could not readily be separated without
retirement of these general mortgage bonds. In the second
place, the operating relations between the railroads and their
subsidiary coal companies, had for years been fixed upon the
general principle of concentrating all profit from the two conjoined
transactions of mining and carriage upon the transportation
service alone. In other words, freight rates were
established at so high a percentage of the selling price of coal that
mining was necessarily conducted at a nominal profit, if any.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
This made no difference to the carriers, owning both mines and
roads, but it had the desired effect of making it impossible for
coal operators, independent of the railroads, to engage in the
business. Without a modification of this plan the coal companies,
already separately organized for the business by most
of the railroads, could hardly be disposed of to advantage, either
to the general public or even to their own shareholders. The
only coal companies controlled by railroads which independently
showed a considerable book-keeping profit were those owned by
the Jersey Central and the Delaware and Hudson roads. The
Lehigh Valley Coal Company had never paid dividends to its
railroad corporation, but had contented itself with providing a
very profitable tonnage. The Philadelphia and Reading Coal
and Iron Company had likewise never been allowed to show a
book-keeping profit sufficient to meet the interest upon its
bonds and to provide for a sinking fund against exhaustion of
its assets under ground.</p>

<p>Despite these practical obstacles, a general legal separation
of hard-coal mining from transportation is in a fair way to be
effected.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> The Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western in 1909
was the first to act. With no joint mortgages and a charter
right to mine coal directly, it merely organized a separate corporation,
the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Coal Company.
The capital stock of this concern was then distributed
gratis as a special dividend among its own shareholders. This
coal company at once purchased all of the railroad's coal in
stock, leased its mining appurtenances, and agreed henceforth
to purchase all of its coal at the mine mouth for sixty-five per
cent. of the tidewater price. The railroad continued to mine
coal, but thus disposed of it before accepting it again for carriage.
The Delaware and Hudson likewise entered into a contract with
a coal company organized in 1901, which, after June, 1909,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>agreed to purchase all of its future output. The Lehigh Valley
Railroad rearrangement was more complicated. It already had
a coal company of the same name, the capital stock of which
was pledged under its general railroad mortgage. Ownership
was thus indissoluble. So the Lehigh Valley <i>Coal Sales</i> Company
was organized in January, 1912. Its capital of $10,000,000
was provided by the railroad, which declared a stock dividend
to its own shareholders, sufficient in amount to enable them to
subscribe to the capital of the new concern. This company,
then, like the others above mentioned, thereupon agreed to
purchase all the coal mined by the railroad's subsidiary coal
corporation.</p>

<p>At this writing great speculative interest attaches to the
probable plan to be adopted by the Reading. Its intricate
organization,<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> whereby both the railroad and the coal companies
are owned by a purely finance or holding company,
renders the problem of dissociation unique. A large volume
of joint bonds are outstanding, with complicated provisions
for sinking funds. The railroad actually owns no coal lands.
The coal company, independently, is not profitable under
existing traffic arrangements. Its operating ratio in 1911 was
98.7 per cent. It is "land poor"; carrying vast reserves of
coal purchased by bond issues. The only asset sufficiently
profitable by itself to make it attractive as a gift to shareholders,
is the subsidiary coal company of the Jersey Central Railroad,
which is itself controlled by means of stock ownership. The
formation of a third coal sales company, whose stock could be
distributed to shareholders of the Reading, as was done by the
Lehigh Valley, would seem to be the only feasible plan.</p>

<p>But is there not danger, financially, for these and other
railroads, that they may place this lucrative traffic in jeopardy
by thus distributing their coal properties among shareholders
by means of stock dividends? While, for a time, community of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
interest between railroad and coal mine may be assured through
lodgment of stock ownership of both companies in the same
persons, is it not likely that the two may become widely dissociated
in the course of time? This contingency has been
guarded against by an ingenious provision. The contracts
providing for purchase and shipment of coal by the coal sales
companies are terminable at the will of the railroad. So that
if conflict of interest should arise in future, through transfers
of stock of the coal sales company to outsiders, the carriers
would be free to cancel the arrangement; create another corporation;
distribute its shares among their stockholders once
more; and thereafter go on as before. Manifold and ingenious,
indeed, are the devices of the law for purposes of circumvention!</p>

<p>Whether the "commodity clause" is to bring about a further
separation of transportation from activities of carriers in other
lines of business remains to be seen. It was doubtless intended
to have a general application. Some roads, other than those
in the anthracite coal fields, have taken steps to set off their
subsidiary concerns. The Louisville &amp; Nashville, for example,
has distributed among its stockholders all the shares of
the Louisville Properties Company. This is a Kentucky corporation
to which the railroad had transferred its holdings of
coal and other lands. It was expected at the time that its
capital stock of $600,000 would be worth par. The Union
Pacific has done even better. It voluntarily reconveyed to the
United States considerable tracts of coal lands, where title had
been called in question in the course of investigations as to such
railroad ownership. While there has been no sign of the Pennsylvania
Railroad disposing of its investments in the Cambria
and Pennsylvania Steel Companies, made prior to 1906, it is
clear that the interdiction of the law will render any further
outside operations of this sort difficult if not impossible.</p>

<p>The course of events after 1906, so far as acquiescence in
the law was concerned, was precisely like that of twenty years
earlier. For some time the railroads seemed submissive,&mdash;in
almost a chastened mood. The Commission also exercised its
new powers rather timidly. Up to July 1, 1908, only a single
appeal to the Federal courts had been taken by the carriers
against orders of the Commission. A sudden change of front
supervened at this time. During the second half of that year,
sixteen suits to set aside orders of the Commission were filed.
Nine more were entered in the following year, and thirteen
during 1910; with the result that the dockets were greatly congested
with proceedings of this sort. No less than thirty-six
were before the circuit courts, when in 1910 they were all
transferred to the newly constituted Commerce Court, soon to
be described. This accumulation of unfinished business, with
the consequent delay in settlement of important transportation
disputes, contributed greatly to the movement in Congress in
favor of further amendment of the law.</p>

<p>There were several reasons for this sudden shift of attitude
toward the law in 1908 on the part of the carriers. The political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
atmosphere had suddenly cleared so far as popular hostility to
railroads was concerned. A change of administration had
ensued, with a marked preponderance of professional legal
talent in the Cabinet. And several important decisions of the
Supreme Court, once threatening, had now been rendered in
favor of the carriers. Among these may be mentioned the
first interpretation of the "commodity clause,"&mdash;on the one
hand upholding the constitutionality of the law, and on the
other, pointing the broad and easy way to its evasion; the
Harriman decision, protecting witnesses from disclosure of
details as to their personal participation in the finances of companies
under their control; and the exculpation of the Standard
Oil Company by the aid of eminent counsel and the technicalities
of the law, with escape from the extreme penalties of the
statutes for rebating and personal favoritism. Things seemed
indeed to be going at last the railroads' way.</p>

<p>The brightening financial outlook also gave better heart to
the carriers. The panic of 1907, with its forced postponement
of ambitiously constructive plans, seemed to have passed.
The revival of these projects might be hampered by a further
extension of government regulation and publicity. Railroad
labor, moreover, was becoming restive. Demands for increased
wages were imminent; and the carriers evidently proposed to
shift the incidence of these wage increases, if granted, upon the
public by means of an advance of rates. Such increases were
bound to be disputed. It was deemed important to test the
law at every point. This need was the more imperative as the
Commission itself was bound to pass upon several questions of
fundamental importance, such as the adjustment of transcontinental
freight schedules and others soon to be described.</p>

<p>A presidential campaign took place in 1908. Both political
parties committed themselves in their platforms to still further
amendment of the Interstate Commerce Law. The Republican
party, however, modestly confined its recommendations to
authorization of traffic agreements and the regulation of stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
and bond issues by railroads for the prevention of over-capitalization.
The Democrats offered a much broader program
providing for real amplification of the power of the Commission
over rates. President Taft,&mdash;well in advance of his
party, controlled as it was by the so-called "regulars,"&mdash;offered
soon after election a more definite policy. Its main feature was
the establishment of a Court of Commerce to which all judicial
review of orders of the Commission should be submitted, in
lieu of revision by the regularly constituted Federal judiciary.
He evidently proposed to seriously amend the law; but, beyond
the foregoing proposition, most of the other details of his plan
seemed to be either half-way measures or else ill-designed to
meet the real difficulties of the case. Thus the proposal to
give power over mere rules and regulations in advance of their
taking effect, without at the same time conferring a like power
to pass upon the reasonableness of rates themselves, seemed to
miss the main point. The same criticism was applicable to the
plan of conferring authority to postpone the taking effect of a
new classification until it had been approved by the Commission.
Other excellent details were such as conferred authority
to compel through routes and to forbid stockholding by one
road in other competing lines, set forth in speeches in the fall
of 1909.</p>

<p>A special presidential message of January 7, 1910, contained
the specific program recommended for legislation to Congress.
It consisted merely of a tentative bill, which was introduced in
both houses and properly referred.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> By this time the influence
of the Interstate Commerce Commission in strengthening the
proposals was apparent. More positive provisions were added,
such as the right to suspend rate increases pending determination
of their reasonableness. Serious consideration was given
this bill in appropriate committees both of the House and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>Senate. It was, in fact, with the consent of the Attorney-General,
amended out of all semblance to its original form.
The most serious changes were made in the Committee on
Interstate Commerce of the House of Representatives. The
coalition of Democrats and "insurgent" or "progressive"
Republicans, succeeded in striking out the authorization of
traffic agreements, as well as a proposition permitting a railroad
owning a majority of stock in other non-competing lines to
purchase the balance of their shares. Several radical amendments
of the Commerce Court plan were likewise effected,
especially those giving the power of appointment to the Chief
Justice instead of the President. The hands of the "progressives"
in all this work were considerably strengthened, without
doubt, by the course of events during the spring months
of 1910, especially the impending general increase of freight
rates all over the country.</p>

<p>The strength of political sentiment in favor of the measure
appears in the fact that the radical House bill was passed
unanimously; while the Senate bill was adopted by a solid
Republican vote with the aid of six Democrats,&mdash;the total vote
being fifty to eleven. Reference to a conference committee,
which considered it for ten days, still further modified the
original plan. Pooling was dropped entirely; stock-watering
and details of inter-corporate finance between non-competing
lines were also thrown but as favoring the carriers unduly.
Physical valuation, as provided in the House bill, was considerably
restricted. Prompt approval of the conference bill
followed in both houses. And the signature of the President
was added on June 18. Thus did the Mann-Elkins "Amendments"
become law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three most important features of the Mann-Elkins Act<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
were: the grant of power to suspend changes in rates for examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>as to their reasonableness; resuscitation of the long
and short haul clause; and the creation of the Commerce Court
for review of the Commission's orders. Of these, the first two
represent substantial extension of the regulative power of the
government; the third being a mere modification of procedure
on appeal.</p>

<p>The proposition to so amend Section 15<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> of the Act of 1887
as to confer power upon the Commission to suspend proposed
changes in rates, seems to have been a feature added at the
behest of the insurgent-Democratic coalition in Congress. It
was neither in the President's first unofficial program nor in
the formal bill drawn up by the Attorney-General. The
intolerable obstructions in the way of prompt determination of
transportation disputes incident to the practical working of the
law, even since 1906, had created a renewed demand for relief.
Great force was added to this demand among shippers by the
rate advances which had been occurring all along the line for
two years; and particularly by the rumors of a general rate
advance by the western and trunk line roads during the progress
of the debate upon the bill. The President, to be sure, blocked
this advance by means of a clever legal and political move.
On May 31 an injunction was issued against twenty-four
carriers, temporarily restraining them from putting into effect
higher tariffs, as they had planned on June 1. This action was
taken upon the allegation that the simultaneous action of all
these roads in so doing constituted a violation of the Anti-Trust
Law. The injunction, which as a weapon had been
turned mainly by the carriers against enforcement of the orders
of the Commission, was now invoked against the railroads.
Regardless as to whether a <i>bona fide</i> prosecution was contemplated,
the effect of these equity proceedings was to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>postponement of the advance in rates; and, of course, at the
same time forcibly to attract the attention of Congress to the
necessity of control. The carriers withdrew their tariffs in
some discomfiture; the injunctions were dissolved; and all
proceedings were stopped.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, perhaps, to repeat the demonstration that a
loss by shippers once incurred through payment of an unreasonable
rate, is irretrievable. The manner in which transportation
costs enter into the profitableness of contracts by the shipper for
future delivery is well known.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Any change of rates during a period
for which shippers have contracted to deliver at fixed prices,
must seriously affect the chances of profit. It was recognized
as essential, therefore, that adequate protection for the shipper
could be given only through suspension of any change in rates
until the reasonableness of that change had been determined.</p>

<p>The extent to which the aid of the courts had been invoked
by the carriers to set aside orders of the Commission has already
been described. Proceedings on the equity side in the courts
had also, although in a most unsatisfactory manner, been undertaken
to restrain advances in rates. But in all cases the exercise
of this power had been bitterly contested, and proved at best
to be so cumbersome as to be almost futile. The utmost confusion
resulted in some cases. For example, in 1908 the carriers
filed notice of an advance in rates on boots and shoes from New
England to the South. An injunction was obtained prohibiting
such advance, on condition that application be immediately
made to the Commission for a ruling upon the reasonableness
of the proposed change. This would have left the carriers
without choice except to collect one rate while continuing to
publish another. They therefore withdrew their schedules,
leaving the old rates in effect. As a result no complaint could
be filed with the Commission, the new rate not having come into
operation. To meet this situation, the court then so modified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
its injunction that carriers might publish the advanced schedule,
but were restrained from collecting it. This was manifestly
an absurd situation. Moreover, supposing that the Commission
could immediately take up the question, no order could
become effective until after thirty days. In the meantime, the
whole matter must remain in suspense. Considering that
15,000 tariffs advancing rates in trunk line territory alone,
were filed in July, 1910, the necessary delay incident to such
roundabout procedure would render it intolerable. Other
complications might be mentioned, such as the localization of
injunctions within the territorial jurisdiction of the enjoining
court; legal technicalities touching the filing of bonds; and the
status of non-petitioning shippers. Speedy relief must be had:
that was clear beyond question.</p>

<p>Aside from the practical unworkableness of the injunction
process as a protection against unreasonable rate advances,
reform might well be demanded on grounds of fairness. No
reduction of rates ought to be compelled without opportunity
for protest by the carrier. Contrariwise, no new burden should
be laid upon the shipper without a hearing. The burden of
proof against disturbance of a long-standing adjustment ought
properly to rest upon the party responsible for the change.
Such delay as was requisite for determination of the reasonableness
of the change could not constitute a serious burden;
and even if it did, it was but just under the attendant
circumstances.</p>

<p>The new law yielded to these arguments by a radical extension
of the authority of the Commission. It was authorized to
suspend the taking effect of any new rate or regulation for not
more than one hundred and twenty days, to afford opportunity
for hearing and decision as to its reasonableness. If necessary,
a further period of six months' suspension might be had. Moreover,
the burden of proof that the change was just and reasonable
was laid upon the carrier. Beyond the ten months' period
thus allowed, postponement might not extend. Thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
the rates became effective automatically. This control fell
short of the demand of the "insurgents" that downright
approval of the Commission for all changes should be required;
but it was, nevertheless, a substantial increase of power. It
remains to be seen what the practical result of this great extension
of government control may be. It was predicted that
its greatest benefit would come from those suspensions of rate
advances which ultimately brought about their withdrawal.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
This prophecy was fulfilled, as will be seen in the next chapter,
in the first great test to which the law was put, almost immediately
after its passage.</p>

<p>Resuscitation of the long and short haul clause of the Act
of 1887 was the second important feature of the new legislation.
The long and tedious process of judicial interpretation, by means
of which this section of the statute was nullified for so many
years, has already been set forth.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Dissatisfaction with the
local discrimination prevalent throughout the southern states
and in the Rocky mountain region had been steadily increasing
for a long time. Public opinion in these districts urgently
demanded the relief which the original law sought to afford.
Chairman Knapp fairly described the situation in 1905 before
the Elkins Committee as follows:<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>&mdash;"No one, I think, can
read the Fourth section ... and be in doubt that Congress
intended to provide some actual and potential restraint upon
that particular form of discrimination. And, I may say, it
remains today much as it was then, not the greatest evil, but
the most irritating and obnoxious form of discrimination that
has been encountered." No distributing business could hope
to become established in the West or South without vitalizing
this section of the law. The larger cities, and particularly the
manufacturing districts in the East, on the other hand, viewed
with alarm any encroachment upon the far distant markets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>which they were able to hold by reason of peculiarly low rates.
The railroads' co&ouml;peration with eastern representatives in
Congress had successfully prevented any change in 1906.
But four years later it became apparent early in the debates that
something would have to be done for the relief of the West and
South.</p>

<p>The long and short haul clause was amended by the influence
of the Progressive Republicans in the House.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> Four changes
were made. The first was the total elimination of the clause
"under substantially similar circumstances and conditions,"
which had been responsible for almost all of the trouble in the
courts. This change made it necessary in all cases in future for
permission to be secured in advance from the Commission for
any lesser charge for a long haul than for a shorter one, no
matter what the local circumstances might be. Secondly, the
prohibition was specifically made to cover "routes" as well as
"lines." Although the Osborne case<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> had already virtually
made it clear that the clause applied to a series of connecting
railways as well as to a single company, this addition placed the
matter beyond dispute. The third change, practically legalizing
a standing rule of the Commission for many years, prohibited
a higher through rate than the sum of the local charges over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>same line.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> An addition covering an entirely new point constituted
the fourth modification of the section. It is suggestive
as an indication of the determined spirit which animated Congress.
This last detail was borrowed from the then recently
submitted report of the National Waterways Commission,
which in turn had borrowed it from the state constitution of
California. It was intended to meet the tactics so often
adopted by land carriers in competition with water lines, of
drastically reducing rates until the competition by water had
been killed, after which the losses were recouped by even higher
tariffs than before.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> Under the new law, no railroad, having
once reduced its rates in competition with a water route, was
permitted to increase those charges until the Interstate Commerce
Commission should have found that such proposed
increase rested upon changed conditions other than the
elimination of water competition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Improvement of the procedure on appeal, by the establishment
of the Commerce Court, was the third important feature
of the new law. It was not only the delay of which complaint
was made, but the illogical process of review as well. For this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>permitted the orders of a technically expert commission of
seven men to be set aside by the order of a single judge who, in
fact, relied upon subordinates for an examination of the evidence
as to economic fact. This may be illustrated by two
recent cases. In 1907 the transcontinental railroads substantially
increased their rates on lumber. The Commission
held that this advance was unreasonable; but permitted one half
of it to take place. The carriers appealed to the Federal
Circuit Court. All the evidence, involving great money and
commercial considerations, was taken for the court by a master.
Upon the findings of this single individual, without opportunity
for the court to critically examine the evidence, the deliberate
judgment of the Interstate Commerce Commission was set aside.
The same thing happened in the Texas Cattle Raisers' case in
1910, involving rates on live stock from the southwest to
northern ranges. In this instance, to be sure, the Circuit
Court declined to enjoin the Commission. That did not,
however, alter the fact that the decision was based upon hearings
by a master, extending over sixty-three days and rolling up a
voluminous record which the court did not have time even to
peruse cursorily. To standardize procedure, as well as to
eliminate delay, was the purpose of the President in the plan
for the Commerce Court.</p>

<p>Many objections were advanced in the course of debate
in Congress against the creation of a special tribunal. It was
urged that such a court with limited jurisdiction would be open
to political influence, as well as exposed to the danger of narrowness.
It was said to be foreign to our judicial organization,
which heretofore had known only courts of general jurisdiction.
It was stated that no necessity for a commerce court existed,
so small would be the number of cases which might be brought
before it. Objection was also raised to it on the ground of
expense. The problem of court review was, of course, complicated
rather than made more simple by the Hepburn Act of
1906. Prior to that time no administrative orders took effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
other than through enforcement by the courts. But this law
provided that rates and regulations of the Commission should
take effect <i>proprio vigore</i> within thirty days. The contest over
broad <i>v.</i> narrow court review has already been described,
with the outcome at the time regarded as a victory for broad
review. The situation was entirely changed, however, by the
Illinois Central decision in 1910,<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> which appeared to put a
restraint upon judicial review, except when the order of the
Commission was either beyond its legal powers or else unconstitutional.
This decision did not, as might have been expected,
put an end to the plan for a new transportation court; but it
did bring about a specific restriction of the powers of this
tribunal to those possessed by the regular circuit courts.</p>

<p>The Commerce Court, as finally constituted in 1910, was
composed of five judges, each to serve for five years, designated
and assigned thereto by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
from among the circuit judges of the United States. No
member might serve continuously for more than one term,
but might be reappointed after an interval of one year. The
court was to sit at Washington, and was to be always open for
the transaction of business. From it, direct appeal to the
Supreme Court might be taken, with as simple a mode of procedure
as possible to eliminate delay. The original record, for
example, was to be transmitted; and agents of every carrier
must be designated at Washington upon whom process might
at any time be served. Whatever may be said of other details
of this judicial experiment, it certainly sought in good faith to
promote promptness in procedure.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of this Commerce Court was expressly
conferred over four kinds of cases:<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p><i>First</i>, those for enforcement of any order of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, other than the payment of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second</i>, cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend,
in whole or in part, any order of the Commission.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, all proceedings on appeal under the Elkins amendments
of 1903 with reference to rebates or departure from the
published tariffs.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, all proceedings concerning the enforcement of the
law in respect of publicity of accounts, the furnishing of facilities,
or compulsion in the movement of traffic.</p>

<p>Proceedings in the first class above mentioned, for enforcement
of orders of the Commission, remained practically unchanged
in form, except that they were to be prosecuted in the
Commerce Court instead of in the ordinary circuit courts.
Cases of the second sort, wherein the carrier sought to enjoin
or set aside orders of the Commission, were somewhat modified
in procedure. The Administration bill provided that the
Commerce Court should not issue injunctions, except in cases
where irreparable damage would follow. In this regard, the
Senate succeeded in somewhat amplifying judicial control.
Five days' preliminary notice to the Commission, secured in
1906 after a bitter contest, was now cut down to three days;
and the full court might extend the temporary stay of sixty
days granted by a single judge, over the entire period necessary
for final decision by the Supreme Court. With this exception,
the new law held all the ground gained by the Hepburn Act as
judicially interpreted in the Illinois Central case.</p>

<p>The principal criticism which may be directed against the
Commerce Court, as thus organized, is that, instead of being an
unchanging body of judges, becoming expert in the details of
transportation by long experience, its membership must change
year by year. Fortunately, at the outset the court was favored
by the appointment, as presiding justice, of the Chairman of
the Interstate Commerce Commission; but it seems likely that
the lack of experience and technical knowledge in this ever-changing
body may render it an obstruction rather than an
assistance in fixing the responsibility for the settlement of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
important cases. Specialization ought to be as beneficial here
as in all other departments of government. It is a pity that
the original plan of a permanent court should finally have been
changed, through the insistence of the carriers' representatives,
to a tribunal, each of whose members no sooner becomes proficient
in the details of his work than he is marked for transfer to
other fields of activity.</p>

<p>Next to the creation of the Commerce Court, the most
important change in procedure introduced in 1910 was the
transfer of the task of prosecuting suits on appeal cases from the
Interstate Commerce Commission to the Federal Department of
Justice. The confusion of governmental powers in the past,
through permitting the Commission to prosecute cases in the
Federal courts in which it already had an interest, has already
been described. It was obviously illogical that a body having
once rendered an opinion should then appear in court in defence
of its own order. The jealousy of the Department of Justice
in this regard was probably responsible also for the change
effected in the law. The amendment of 1910 provides that
hereafter all cases and proceedings, either in the Commerce
Court or the Supreme Court, shall be brought in the name of the
United States under the charge and control of the Attorney-General.
It was provided also that the Commission or "any
party or parties in interest" might appear of their own motion
and as of right, and might be represented by counsel. Communities,
associations, or individuals interested in the
controversy were authorized to intervene, and the Attorney-General
was forbidden to discontinue any proceedings over the
objection of such parties in interest.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> This apparently reasonable
procedure was authorized after vehement protest of shippers
against the original administration program. The Senate
objected to it on the ground that it "would introduce intolerable
confusion in legal proceedings and subordinate the general
interests of all the people to the selfish concerns of one or more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>parties." And the Commission insisted throughout that it
must participate in such suits, else no competent parties would
be at hand to guide the prosecution in complicated proceedings.</p>

<p>Several provisions in the law were aimed at specific abuses
which had been revealed in the course of prosecutions under
the criminal provisions of the Act. The original law provided
for the posting of tariffs in public places, in order that shippers
might inform themselves as to the scheduled rates. But the
possibilities of concealment of special favors, as well as the mere
mechanical difficulty of ascertaining the facts in so complicated
a maze of descriptions and rules with all sorts of exceptions, made
it necessary that the shipper should rely upon information
obtained from the agent. Nor could the shipper recover for
losses incurred through misquotation of the rate by this agent
inasmuch as the carriers must collect according to the tariff,
under severe penalties for departure therefrom. Even a mistake
by the agent in quoting the wrong rate did not permit of recovery.
The new law met this contingency by the requirement
that the railroad should quote the rate upon written request;
and should be liable to a penalty of $250 for mis-statement from
which loss to the shipper should result. The requirement that
both the request and the reply as to rates should be written,
it was hoped, would facilitate detection of rebating in the future.
Another clause added a penalty of $1000 and made it a misdemeanor
for any carrier or its agent to disclose information
concerning either the route or destination of any shipment,
when such information might be used to the injury of a competing
shipper. Solicitation of such information was also
penalized. The abuse against which this provision of law was
directed is well illustrated in the prosecution of the so-called
Powder Trust in 1911. It appeared in one instance that a
freight agent had been paid from $15 to $18 a month for furnishing
weekly statements of the shipments, with addresses of consignees,
made by a competing concern in Chattanooga.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>outrageous espionage, long practised by the Standard Oil
Company, it is to be hoped will be eliminated in future by this
provision of law.</p>

<p>Certain details of the act may be dismissed with mere
mention. The scope of regulation was extended to include
telegraph, telephone, and cable companies. The Commission
was specifically authorized to establish and enforce reasonable
classification of freight. Such authority, to be sure, had been
continuously exercised for years; but this clause put it beyond
dispute. A leaf was taken from the experience before the
Supreme Court in interpretation of the authority over through
routes and joint rates in the "Portland Gateway" case, described
in the preceding chapter. Other "reasonable or satisfactory
routes" were more specifically defined; although the
complicated phraseology adopted was of doubtful value. It
may well be that the clause, under judicial interpretation, limited
rather than amplified the Commission's power as compared
with the law of 1906. But the added requirement that every
carrier must provide reasonable facilities for the operation of
through routes, proper rules for the interchange of cars, etc.,
was bound to promote the efficiency of through business. The
experience in the "Orange Routing" cases, also, brought about
a clear affirmation in the new statute of the right of a shipper to
designate the route which he preferred for shipment over connecting
lines. The shipper might also demand a bill of lading
conformable to his instructions. Whether this freedom of
choice to the shipper, with the incidental assumption of responsibility
for all consequences, regardless of strikes, blockades,
or acts of God, will work to his advantage in the long run remains
to be seen. He may probably rely upon strict enforcement
of the so-called Carmack amendment of 1906, which
makes the initial carrier liable for damage, even if it occurs off
its own line. And, finally, among the minor changes in 1910 was
the authorization of the Commission to institute inquiries upon
its own initiative. Such power had frequently been exercised;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
but in the enactment of the Hepburn Act four years before, certain
verbal inconsistencies were introduced into Section 15. It
was deemed best to remedy this error by complete authorization
to undertake investigations either with or without complaint.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In place of regulation of the issues of stocks and bonds by
Federal authority, as pledged in the political platforms, the
almost unanimous opposition in the Senate to such a plan,
brought about the substitution of a Railroad Securities Commission
to investigate the subject. This, after all, was probably
wise; inasmuch as many details as to conflicting state and
Federal powers in such matters, were yet to be determined
judicially. Moreover, the plans proposed, as it appeared, were
so complicated that their adoption might result in the validation
of all capitalization then outstanding without reference
to its real value. The question certainly merited further investigation
at the hands of experts.</p>

<p>Under the authority above mentioned, the President appointed
an able although distinctly conservative commission,
headed by President Hadley of Yale University. This body
rendered its report in November, 1911.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> The document was
concise, cogent in reasoning (with the exceptions noted below),
wise in its general conclusions and eminently conciliatory in
spirit. It was obviously intended to promote good relations
between the government and the carriers. The dominant
note was complete publicity as a corrective for all financial
abuses of the time. The adequacy of this remedy was probably
exaggerated. The wise accounting provisions of the Acts of
1906-1910<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> were certainly already far-reaching in effect. The
Securities Commission proposed, however, that they be elaborated
to cover fully all phases both of promotion and of subsequent
finance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span></p>

<p>Not less important and wise than the insistence upon
financial publicity, was the recommendation that, until the
Supreme Court had clearly defined the relations between
Federal and state authority, the Federal government should
refrain from attempting to regulate the issue of securities.
Too many difficult legal complications remained to be cleared
up.</p>

<p>There certainly should have been a more enthusiastic commendation
of the efforts of states like Massachusetts, Wisconsin,
Texas and New York to cope with their local problems of financial
control.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> The apparent absence of a due appreciation of
the importance of the work of the various public service commissions
all over the country may perhaps be accounted for on
the ground that it lay outside the scope of the work of a purely
Federal commission. Yet a word of encouragement to these
state administrations would have done something to offset the
rather negative character of its conclusions. Someone must
exercise financial control. If inadvisable for the Federal government
to undertake it at this time, as might well be, then it was
important to emphasize the fact that the states must do it as
best they could. On the other hand, the recommendations concerning
physical valuation as an element in rate regulation were
sufficiently progressive to impart an aspect of judicial balance
and general fairness to the report as a whole.</p>

<p>Two specific conclusions of the securities commission,
however, were surely open to debate. One was the contention
that little relation obtains between capitalization and rates. The
statement is, of course, largely true; but like most generalizations
of the sort fails to state the whole truth. It is probably
absolutely true as to <i>particular</i> rates. No one would claim for
a moment that the heavily capitalized Wabash, operating in
trunk line territory alongside the Pennsylvania system, could
charge any higher rates because of its financial disabilities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span></p>
<p>Rather the reverse. But while true of particular rates, capitalization
does exert an <i>indirect</i> but nevertheless a very appreciable
influence upon the <i>general</i> level of rates. For this point I
have argued elsewhere at some length.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Was it surprising
that the pressure for advanced rates in 1910-1911 in trunk line
territory should come from the heavily capitalized New York
Central, with substantial aid and comfort from the Erie?
Was it a mere coincidence that the Lackawanna road, with its
stock quoted above $500, was a less prominent factor in the
agitation than some of its neighbors? True enough, no direct
relation between rates and capitalization exists; but that a
positive incentive to higher charges in general may be found in
the need of supporting a large capitalization seems reasonably
clear in the light of experience. This point was certainly
neglected or glossed over in the report.</p>

<p>A most debatable and, as I hold it, dangerous proposition
in this report was the proposed abolition of the "dollar mark"
upon capital stock. However desirable it might be for mining
companies and the lesser industrials, as in Germany, to do away
with any stated par value for share capital in order to disabuse
the public mind of its purely artificial character, the proposition is
quite different when applied to an industry like a railroad. There
is all the difference in fact between purely private and competitive
conditions of a more or less speculative character, and those
under which monopoly privileges are conferred by gift of the
public. Space does not permit a criticism of this proposition
in detail. I have elsewhere discussed it more at length.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
Many objections occur at once, none of them mentioned in this
report which, almost jauntily, as it seems, proposed to revolutionize
all of our customary habits of financial thought. Among
these objections there is the fact that abolition of par value
removes the restraint upon the promoter or management, for
liability to creditors in case of part-paid shares. The experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>of the Asphalt Company of America is illuminating in this
regard. May we trust mere publicity to provide corresponding
safeguards for honest promotion with this liability removed?
Then again, how about the issue of stock in exchange for
property acquired, as had frequently occurred in the course of
railway consolidation? Was it immaterial whether the absorbing
company put out 500,000 "participating shares," with
a market value of $100 each, or twice that number of "certificates
of participation" commanding half that figure per unit in exchange
for the property acquired? And still further, there is
the inevitable effect upon speculation. One of the primary
needs of the time was to effect a separation of our common
carriers from Wall Street influence. Did it make no difference
whether the Southern Railway "participating shares" were
traded in around $25; or those of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
commanded a price of $150? Low quotations always offer a
great stimulus to speculative manipulation&mdash;as any student of
Rock Island affairs must concede. To do away with par, which
means permission to emit, without reproach, at any figure
"below par"&mdash;how hard it is, indeed, to get rid of that conception
of some standard of normality&mdash;could not but exert a
malign influence. And then, finally, over and above all other
considerations there was the need of some general standard of
comparison for all sorts of purposes&mdash;some base from which to
judge of normality. The proposal to wipe out all such standards,
with the mere warning to public and investors alike to
beware, seemed like a step backward.</p>

<p>This brings us to the insistence of the commission upon the
need of the railroads for more capital for development; and the
difficulty of financing new enterprises under regulative provisions
of law, such as the prohibition of the issue of shares at a discount.
Massachusetts had recently passed through an experience of
probably excessive regulation. But simple modifications of
its anti-stock-watering laws seemed to have solved the difficulty.
Of course the developmental problems of the West and South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
are quite different from those of New England. Yet there was
the experience of Texas to fall back upon. Complaint had been
made, of course, especially by the Gould roads, of the insufficiency
of capital for new work. But the growth of mileage
seemed, nevertheless, to compare not unfavorably with progress
in other states. Were the Gould roads, for example, any
better off in other states where greater liberality of laws prevails?
The fact was that much new construction and improvement
remained to be done all over the country, as this report duly
emphasized; but much of it would probably have to be done by
companies already in the field. Not many new steam railroad
companies are now needed even in the West. It must be
confessed that the recently authorized extension of the Grand
Trunk Railway into the heart of New England shows how persistent
is the demand for new roads even in the East. But
whoever may build, let them learn the lesson, so often forgotten,
that honest management and conservative financing, to the
end that solid credit be first established, has far more to do
with facilitating development than non-interference by law.
This was probably a time when encouragement to the railroads
in a period of stress should properly be given. But let it
not be forgotten that good faith to the public and to stockholders,
together with prudent financing, must be the primary
source of credit.</p>

<p>Many admirable features of this report deserve mention,
did space permit. The clear exposition of the distinction between
stocks and bonds, and especially the discussion of inter-corporate
financing, occupied a prominent place. The document
promised to play a large part in the determination of governmental
policy in future. It well merited the most careful perusal
by legislators, financiers and economists. In the nature of
things so conservative a document could never hope for a
popular reception. But many of its financial platitudes were
probably in need of reiteration for the good, both of the carriers
and the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hepburn Act of 1906, despite the agitation over its
enactment in Congress, "came in like a lion and went out like
a lamb," imitating thereby the month of March in which its
crucial changes were effected. In the end it proved to be a
much less drastic measure than the railroads feared. This
Mann-Elkins law, four years later, on the other hand, introduced
by the presidential bill as a merely supplementary piece of
legislation,<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> "rounding out the Roosevelt policies," emerged
from Congress really radical in character. Every change made
was "progressive"; and yet there was little public interest
manifested on either side. No publicity campaign was carried
on by the carriers. No extended discussion took place in the
press. There were several reasons for this contrast. It is
partly true, as one writer has suggested, that "the marrow
had already been extracted from railroad regulation as a political
issue; and that it had become merely a bone of contention in a
factional strife." Moreover, the fundamental principle of
effective governmental regulation had been indisputably affirmed
in 1906. The Act of 1910 had for its purpose a firmer intrenchment
of the position already occupied. Debate centred
largely upon uninteresting technical questions. The broader
issues were relegated to second place. Even the carriers on
their part were extremely reserved in stating their position.
It was conceded on all sides that the less public opinion in
general was aroused, the lighter would be the sentence passed
upon the prisoners at bar. It is difficult to determine in how far
the marked advance made in this statute was due to contemporary
happenings, like the general advances of freight rates,
the Illinois Central scandals and the like; or to a deep-seated
conviction on the part of the progressive element in Congress.
But that the law, as a whole, was a surprise in the end even to
its proponents is beyond doubt.</p>

<p>A word may be added concerning the omissions in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
Mann-Elkins law. The most important was the elimination
of the administration plan for authorizing agreements between
carriers as to rates, subject to supervision by the Commission.
The Republican platform had definitely promised relief of this
sort to the railroads. The Democratic party had somewhat
equivocally promised an amendment of the law prohibiting
pooling "to make it unlawful, unless approved by the Commission."
The plan, however, met with persistent opposition
on all sides, largely on the ground that it conflicted with the
Sherman Anti-Trust law. Other details which fell by the way
concerned proposals to extend jurisdiction over water carriers
on inland waterways.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Whether the Commission might
exercise any control over those which formed parties to a
through line still remained an open question.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> And then at the
last there was the omission of Congress to deal with the question
of fixing minimum rates or differentials between rates. This
was responsible, as will shortly appear, for much of the difficulty
encountered in the application of the long and short haul clause
to the transcontinental rate problem.</p>

</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Section 4.</span> That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions
of this act to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the
transportation of passengers, or of like kind of property, for a shorter than for a longer distance
over the same line or route in the same direction, the shorter being included within
the longer distance, or to charge any greater compensation as a through route than the
aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this act; but this shall not
be construed as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this act to charge or
receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance: Provided, however
That upon application to the Interstate Commerce Commission such common carrier may
in special cases, after investigation, be authorized by the Commission to charge less for
longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of passengers or property; and the
Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common
carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section: Provided, further, That no
rates or charges lawfully existing at the time of the passage of this amendatory act shall be
required to be changed by reason of the provisions of this section prior to the expiration of
six months after the passage of this act, nor in any case where application shall have been
filed before the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of this section, until a
determination of such application by the Commission.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a carrier by the railroad shall in competition with a water route or routes reduce
the rates on the carriage of any species of freight to or from competitive points, it shall not
be permitted to increase such rates unless after hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission
it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other
than the elimination of water competition."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_698_698" id="Footnote_698_698"></a><a href="#FNanchor_698_698"><span class="label">[698]</span></a> The following account, by W. M. Acworth in the <i>Railway Age Gazette</i>,
of a conversation with the late Collis P. Huntington illustrates the possible
abuse:
</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Southern Pacific built two fine steamers to run between San Francisco and Sacramento,
Cal. They gave a daily service, each boat running up one day, and down the
next, and the passenger fare was $2. A private individual thought he saw his way to
compete with advantage, and bought a smaller boat, which only gave a service every other
day, but, on the other hand, only charged $1 for this service.
</p>
<p>
"The Southern Pacific began to lose money, and when Mr. Huntington next came to
California the position was put before him. 'Would you like to leave me to run this
fight?' said he to the local manager. 'Certainly, sir,' was the reply. 'Is there an old
boat you can buy that could give a service?' Being told that there was, Mr. Huntington
bought it, ordered the two first-class boats to be laid up, and announced that the new purchase
would run alongside the rival boat at a fare of 50 cents. 'Why, sir,' said the local
manager. '50 cents won't pay for the coal.' 'No, I do not suppose it will,' was the answer,
'but when you go to war you have got to fight!"
</p>
<p>
"Before long the owner of the rival boat came to Mr. Huntington and asked him what
he was prepared to do about it. Mr. Huntington replied that he would buy his boat for
$10,000&mdash;I think the sum was. 'But, Mr. Huntington, the boat cost me $20,000, and
she is worth it.' 'Very likely, but I am only going to give you $10,000.' So the fight went
on for a while longer. When the spring came Mr. Huntington was on the point of returning
to New York. He sent word to his rival that he was leaving California the following
week, and that if the matter was not settled before he left, his 50-cent boat would continue
to run till his return the following winter. Whereupon his competitor at once threw up
the sponge and then sold his boat for $10,000. 'Since then,' concluded Mr. Huntington,
'there has been no competition with the Southern Pacific on the Sacramento river.'"</p></div>

<p>The three vital features of the Mann-Elkins law of 1910
were: the creation of the Commerce Court, for the purpose
of expediting the judicial review of cases appealed from the
Interstate Commerce Commission; the grant of power to
suspend rate advances pending examination as to their reasonableness;
and the rehabilitation of the long and short haul
clause. The law was passed on June 18, 1910. Within the
brief period of two years it successfully emerged from a supreme
test respecting rate advances; enough experience had already
been had with the new Commerce Court to warrant an opinion
as to its merits as a special tribunal for the review of transportation
decisions; and, finally, an opinion by the Interstate Commerce
Commission was rendered, and is at this writing under
review by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the most
important case ever likely to arise under the long and short
haul clause. Predictions were freely made in 1910 that certain
shortcomings in the revised law, particularly the failure to
grant control over minimum rates and the establishment of
differentials between rates, would soon have to be remedied.
Experience promptly threw light upon these questions also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
The present is thus an opportune time to review the entire
situation respecting Federal railroad regulation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the Commerce Court was created, fears were entertained
that there would not be enough business to employ its
time. This prediction was far from being realized, judging
by the record of the first year.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> Including thirty-six cases
transferred to it from the various Federal circuit courts, a
total of fifty-seven suits were placed upon its docket up to
December 20, 1911. Fifty-four of these cases directly concerned
orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the
large majority&mdash;forty-four&mdash;being suits brought by carriers
to set aside such orders. The Commission appealed to the
court but once for enforcement of its mandates, the remaining
nine cases being appeals of shippers for relief. But a number
of these suits were withdrawn or dismissed, or else lay outside
the class of what may fairly be called contested cases. Only
thirty-eight of them were in reality of significance as throwing
light upon the function of the court as an appellate tribunal,
standing between the Interstate Commerce Commission and
the Supreme Court of the United States. Thirty of these were
disposed of up to December 20, 1911. That the court took
itself seriously as a check upon, rather than a co&ouml;rdinate body
with the Commission, was evidenced by the fact that restraining
orders or final decrees in favor of the railroads and against
the shippers and the Commission were issued in all but three
really important cases out of the entire thirty. And even of
these three cases the Commerce Court held two to be outside
its jurisdiction, while in the third the carriers had already
joined in the view of the Commission, so that there was really
no contest.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span></p>

<p>A bitter campaign for the abolition of the Commerce Court,
as a result of the tendency of its decisions, was waged in Congress
during the session of 1911-1912. The House of Representatives,
in response to popular feeling, promptly passed a
bill abolishing it forthwith, the vote standing 120 to 49, with
many Republicans joining the Democrats in its condemnation.
A sharp contest was precipitated in the Senate over "the legislative
recall of judges," as the matter was not inaptly termed.
The Administration, through the Attorney-General, ably defended
the imperilled court.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Evidence was adduced to show
that the Commission had been sustained in a larger proportion
of cases than under the old circuit court system;<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> that injunctions
had not issued with greater freedom than formerly and
that none of them turned upon questions of fact; and, finally,
that the Administration plan had been very much more expeditious.
But so far as Congress was concerned this evidence
seems not to have been convincing. The Senate soon followed
the House of Representatives, by a vote of thirty-six to twenty-three
defeating an amendment to the Legislative, Executive
and Judicial Appropriation Bill that made provision for further
maintenance of the court. So strong was the feeling that only
by a close vote was an amendment prevented which sought to
legislate the justices out of office as well as out of the Commerce
Court. For without such provision, of course, they
would, under the law of 1910, be reassigned to service in the
circuit courts, from which most of them were drawn. The
final conference agreement between the two houses, appended
to the appropriation bill above mentioned, definitely abolished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>the court, but followed the House plan of reassignment of the
justices to duty in the circuit courts. This bill was twice
vetoed by the President; but the second time, it failed of
re-passage in the Senate over his veto by a narrow margin. In
the House the popular view was expressed by re-passing the
abolition measure by a vote of 149 to 53. These details are
highly significant as indicating the impatience of Congress with
any attempt at interference with the positive program of
administrative control of railroads decreed in 1906-1910. The
fate of the court then rested in the hands of the President, its
original sponsor. A delicate situation, concerning the relations
between Congress and the executive in the matter of
legislative "riders" to appropriation bills, resulted. Whether
such summary proceedings as those initiated by Congress were
warranted by the facts, depended upon the final disposition of
the contested cases by the Supreme Court, before which tribunal
most of them were then pending on appeal. If it appeared
that the court had in reality, as alleged, sought to usurp powers
legitimately exercised by the Commission, the case for abolition
would be greatly strengthened. But in any event, the
certainty of a presidential veto of any law affecting this
pet project of the Administration rendered the attack upon
the Commerce Court for the time being abortive. As the
matter was finally left, Congress acceded to the President's
wishes, continuing the appropriation for maintenance of the
court until March 4, 1913. What will happen in the meantime
after Congress reassembles, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The determination of the proper scope and function of
judicial review was substantially forwarded by several decisions
of the Supreme Court of the United States in June, 1912.
The general effect of these was substantially to curtail the overweening
ambition of the Commerce Court as an intermediate
judicial body. Following the Goodrich Transit Company
opinion<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> which first reversed the Commerce Court, all three of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>these latest opinions on appeal again favored the Interstate
Commerce Commission as against its judicial reviewer. In
two instances, the assumed jurisdiction of the new court was
denied; while in the third, although jurisdiction was recognized,
its decision was reversed. Because of their bearing upon
subsequent developments, a brief review of these cases may
not be out of place.</p>

<p>The Proctor and Gamble Company, well-known soap manufacturers,
had complained of certain regulations concerning
demurrage upon their tank cars. The Commission upheld
the carriers, affirming that their rules were proper and lawful.
The complainants thereupon appealed to the Commerce Court,
which claimed jurisdiction to award pecuniary relief, although
in this instance it declined so to do, on the ground that the
Commission had rightfully decided the matter in the first
instance. Appeal then followed to the Supreme Court, with
the odd circumstance that the Commission and the railways
joined issue against the shippers. The question was largely a
legal one, involving definition of the jurisdiction of the new
tribunal. The Supreme Court in this instance,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>&mdash;and, it
may be added, in the Cincinnati Freight Bureau case,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> which
similarly involved the relative powers of the court and the
Commission,&mdash;unanimously affirmed the right of the Commission
to decide such matters of fact finally.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To recognize the existence in the court below [the Commerce Court]
of the power which it deemed it possessed, would result in frustrating
the legislative public policy which led to the adoption of the act.
The act creating the Commerce Court was intended to be but a part of
the existing system for the regulation of interstate commerce.... It
was not intended to destroy the existing machinery or method of
regulation, but to cause it to be more efficient.... Wholly irrespective
of the general considerations stated, we think the conclusion
of the [Commerce] Court, as to its possession of jurisdiction over the
subject referred to, was clearly repugnant in other respects to the
express terms of the act.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a pronouncement, following the line of decisions headed
by the Illinois Central Car Distribution case,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> must make for
concentration of responsibility and more effective regulation
in the years to come.</p>

<p>The third decision of the Supreme Court, above referred to,
was known as the "Restrictive Rate case."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Might railway
companies&mdash;the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and others&mdash;charge a
different rate for the carriage of coal to railways than to other
shippers, the coal being intended for the use of the railways as
fuel? In this instance the Commission forbade the practice.
Its order was then promptly enjoined by the Commerce Court.
Jurisdiction of the Commerce Court was conceded by the
Supreme Court in this instance also, but its opinion was again
flatly reversed. The issue at bottom was really one of value
of service as against cost of service in the determination of
reasonable rates. Obviously the cost of carrying railway-fuel
coal between two given points is practically the same as that
of carrying commercial coal. The Commission, supported now
by the Supreme Court in frowning upon any difference in the
charge, was thus according priority to this consideration of
cost. The view of the Commerce Court, which was here
reversed, tended, on the other hand, to emphasize such facts
as that the two sorts of coal were intended for different purposes
and did not come in competition with one another as to price.
In other words, value of service&mdash;what the traffic would bear&mdash;was
given greater weight than mere considerations of cost.
The Supreme Court declined to accept this view, preferring
to regard transportation as a matter of physical carriage of
goods, rather than to look beyond this essential service "to
the greater or less inducement to seek the service"&mdash;that is to
say, to regard its commercial aspects.</p>

<p>The last of this batch of Supreme Court decisions was
mainly a question at law, namely the right of the Commerce
Court to enjoin the enforcement of an order of the Commission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>concerning certain allowances for lighterage and terminal service
on sugar in New York harbor.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The judicial poise of the
Supreme Court was here evidenced in its affirmation of the right
of the Commerce Court to issue the injunction. The plain purpose
of the law in setting up this intermediate tribunal as a safeguard
against abuse of administrative authority was given effect;
but it was ordered, nevertheless, that the case be remanded,
to be disposed of on its merits before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the forum selected by Congress for that purpose.</p>

<p>The grist of cases appealed to the Commerce Court may profitably
be divided for discussion into two groups, namely, those
which clearly concerned questions of law and those in which
matters of fact, or economic conclusions based thereon, were
primarily at stake. The first group of purely law cases need
detain us but briefly. There could be little doubt about the
necessity of judicial review of law findings of the Commission.
The best illustration is afforded by the first decision of the
Commerce Court to be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Inland water carriers were not placed under
the jurisdiction of the Act to Regulate Commerce by the
Mann-Elkins amendments of 1910, except in so far as they were
joined in control with railroads or might enter into arrangements
for continuous shipments with carriers by land. But the
Commission, having always required railroads to file accounts
covering both their local and interstate business, called upon
the carriers on the Great Lakes to render similar statements
as to their entire traffic, whether subject to Federal control or
not. This the water lines refused to do. The Commerce
Court, in overruling the Commission, did not question the
power of Congress to require such accounts, but held that it
was its intention to confine publicity to that portion of the lake
traffic over which the jurisdiction of the Commission actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>extended. It thus appears that the law point was doubly
important; inasmuch as its determination affected not alone
the enforcement of publicity for water lines but also of all
carriers by land, so far as their intrastate business was concerned.
Fortunately the Supreme Court, in sustaining the
Commission, held that the Commerce Court had erred in
confusing "knowledge" of intrastate business with its "regulation."
As to the former, the authority of the Commission
was fully upheld. This and the important question upon
which the entire Intermountain rate controversy rested, namely,
as to the authority of the Commission to prescribe relativity of
rates,<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> were the most important points of law at first raised
before the new tribunal. Other legal questions decided by the
Commerce Court&mdash;generally in favor of the railroads, be it
observed&mdash;were: whether reparation might be claimed for an
unreasonable rate when the burden had been already passed
on to the consumer;<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> whether the Nashville Grain Exchange
might lawfully intervene in proceedings before the Commission
under the liberal terms of the law of 1910;<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> whether "separately
established rates" applied by a carrier to through traffic
when there is a through rate but no joint rate are matters of
interstate commerce or not;<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> as to the limitations by law of
the right of carriers to refund overcharges to shippers;<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> and
whether the Union Stockyards Company was a common carrier
engaged in interstate commerce, and thus subject to control as
to preferential treatment of shippers.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> However these cases
might be finally decided by the court of last resort, there could
be no conflict of powers between the Commerce Court and the
Commission in regard to such matters of law. The real bone
of contention between the two bodies&mdash;administrative and
judicial, respectively&mdash;was the question of their respective
powers outside the field of law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving the disputes over law points, we may profitably
consider one further case, important because of its bearing
upon the determination of reasonable rates. This occurred
in 1911 through a revival of the old Maximum (Cincinnati)
Freight Rate case of 1896.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> It will be recalled that this involved
the relative rates to southern centres from eastern and
middle western cities.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> In the original case in 1894, the Commission
held that the rates from Cincinnati were too high by
comparison with the rates from New York; ordering those for
first-class freight, for example, to be reduced from seventy-six
cents to sixty cents per hundred pounds. The Supreme Court
directed a dismissal of the bill of complaint, on the ground that
the Commission had no authority to establish rates for the
future. This defect in the law being remedied by the amendment
of 1906, the Commission, upon a new complaint, made a
second order in 1910. This differed from its earlier decision
in prescribing a reduction of the rate from Cincinnati from
seventy-six cents to only seventy cents, whereas the first
decision had ordered it reduced to sixty cents per hundred
pounds. The Cincinnati shippers, not content with this reduction,
then promptly appealed to the Commerce Court for
a review of the case. The proceeding was unique, therefore,
in that the appeal to the Commerce Court was taken, not by
the carriers but by shippers who complained that the rates
<i>established by the Commission were too high</i>. The Commerce
Court in sustaining the order of the Commission, therefore,
in reality acted in favor of the railroads, being thereby consistent
with its general attitude of conservatism. But its right to
take cognizance of such questions was denied by the Supreme
Court. Thus, in all probability, this famous and protracted
litigation was brought to a close.</p>

<p>The specific law point in this Cincinnati case was as to
whether the reasonableness of a rate should be determined
in the light solely of its effect upon the particular carrier concerned;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>or whether the result for other competing lines and for
the entire territory served, should also be taken into consideration.
The Cincinnati Southern Railroad extended as a short
and direct route 336 miles due south to Chattanooga. It was
neither expensive to construct, to maintain or to operate. It
was the first in the field; having been constructed by the city
of Cincinnati to reach the southern markets. It was not
burdened by unremunerative branch lines. Its net earnings
amounted to over forty per cent. upon the capital stock.
Other competing railroads between the same points were one-third
longer and were otherwise burdened by the necessity of
maintaining unprofitable branches. These other roads could
not be so economically operated. But they had voluntarily
entered the field in competition <i>after</i> this direct line was constructed,
and they had elected to continue therein. The rates
established, however, for the Cincinnati Southern,&mdash;the short
line,&mdash;naturally fixed the rates at which these others had to
participate in the traffic. At the rate of seventy cents, prescribed
in this second order of the Commission, all the carriers
concerned could make a living. The short line alone, presumably,
could have endured the rate of sixty cents as prescribed
at first. Was it lawful, however, to decide a complaint
preferred against a particular most-favored railroad by a city
which built it to attain a certain object, upon the basis of the
effect of such rates, not upon this road but upon others subsequently
built and less fortunately situated? To do so would,
of course, enable the most-favored carrier to prosper exceedingly;
even more so than it did then. But these higher
rates would, most unfortunately, thwart the very purpose
animating its construction. The Commission, sustained by the
majority of the Commerce Court, adopted the latter view.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
A dissenting minority, on the other hand, presented strongly the
opinion that under such special circumstances, in the determi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>nation
as to reasonableness, no right existed for considering the
effect of a rate upon other roads than the particular one against
which the complaint lay. The Supreme Court in affirming
the sole authority of the Commission to pass upon such
issues, nevertheless, left this detail concerning the determination
of reasonableness of rates for possible reargument in future.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

</div>

<p>Attention may be now directed to the controversy as to
the seat of authority, not over law points, but concerning
distinctly economic issues. A typical case before the Commerce
Court concerned rates from New Orleans to several
competing cities on the line of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
Railroad.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> An interesting phase of local discrimination appeared.
The accompanying map discloses the situation.
Normally the through rate from New Orleans to Montgomery
(the long-distance point) would be less than the sum of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>local rates from New Orleans to Mobile (the intermediate
point) and then from Mobile on to Montgomery. This would
conform to the general rule, which is based on the simple fact
that through rates, being competitive, are usually forced below
the level of local charges, commonly unaffected by such competition.
In this case the situation was reversed. Water
competition affected the local rates, both into Mobile from New
Orleans by sea on the one side, and then up the Alabama to
Montgomery by river steamer on the other. But such water
competition did not apply to the through rate, probably
because through shipment by water would necessitate a transfer
<i>en route</i> from a gulf steamer to a river boat at Mobile. Thus
in this case it came about that local competition was keener
than the rivalry as to through traffic. The Louisville &amp; Nashville,
nevertheless, had secured the bulk of the business to
Mobile by reason of the low local rates by rail which had been in
effect for many years, even after practical elimination of the
water lines. The situation was certainly anomalous, from
the viewpoint of cost of service by rail alone; in that the freight
rate was higher on goods sent to Montgomery direct than when
shipped on a combination of local rates on Mobile. This
situation, it is apparent, enabled Mobile jobbers to buy goods
in New Orleans and actually lay them down in Montgomery
for less than the freight charges to the Montgomery dealers
who were on the spot. The same situation prevailed at
Pensacola.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of dispute was the promulgation by
the Commission in 1907, under the new powers conferred by
the Hepburn Act, of a rule that through rates must not exceed
the combination of locals between the same points. To comply
with this rule, the Louisville &amp; Nashville, in this instance,
faced the alternative either of reducing the through rate from
New Orleans to Montgomery to the sum of its local charges
or else of raising one or both of the latter. The railroad naturally
chose the latter course&mdash;now enabled to do so with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
safety as the boat lines had long since been put out of business.
It advanced its local rates from New Orleans to Mobile sufficiently
to make the new combination of local charges equal the
through rate to Montgomery. The Commission, on complaint
of Montgomery, suspended this advance,&mdash;seeking to compel
the railroad to even things up, not by advance of the local
charges but by a reduction of the through rate. This, it is
obvious, would relieve Montgomery of the discrimination as
against Mobile of which it complained. As to none of the facts
above outlined, was there dispute between the court and the
Commission. The controversy turned solely upon which of
the two remedies should be chosen to meet the situation. Were
the through rates unreasonably high? This was the Commission's
contention. If so, equalization should be attained by
their reduction. Or, on the other hand, were the local rates
unreasonably low? If so, they might be evened upward with
propriety. This was the contention of the Commerce Court,
leading it to set aside the order of the Commission. Which
was the body competent to pass upon such an issue? The
Supreme Court had to be called upon to decide. And in the
meantime there was the same old story of delay, while irreparable
loss to shippers went on.</p>

<p>In another instance,&mdash;the California lemon case,&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> the
issue was even more sharply drawn between the Commission
and the Commerce Court. The latter, it was averred, not even
content to draw its own conclusions in matters of fact, had
made an "attempt to look into the mind of the Commission
for the purpose of ascertaining the reasons on which its order
was based." The case dated from 1909, when the blanket
rate from the entire territory east of the Rocky mountains was
advanced by the railroads from $1.00 to $1.15. This action
followed the imposition of a high protective duty on lemons
in the Payne-Aldrich tariff. After careful investigation the
Commission, reviewing the whole matter of rates upon citrus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>fruits, ordered the lemon rate to be reduced once more to $1.00.
Appeal was promptly taken to the Commerce Court, which
set aside the order as beyond the scope of authority delegated
by Congress. The court held that the Commission had sought
so to adjust rates as to afford protection to the California
lemon industry against foreign competition, especially from
the growers in Sicily; in place of confining its attention to the
"intrinsic reasonableness" of the transportation charge. The
gage thus thrown down was promptly taken up by the Commission
in a second opinion, rendered within two months of
the injunction granted by the Commerce Court. This time it
exhaustively considered all phases of the cost and manner of
transportation for oranges and lemons and re-affirmed its
opinion that the rate of one dollar per hundred pounds was
reasonable. At this writing the matter rests there. What the
Commerce Court will do, remains to be seen. The case, as
re-stated by the Commission, is masterly in its discussion of
the responsibilities laid upon it by the law. "Is the country
to be treated as a whole for commercial purposes, or shall it
be infinitely divided?"</p>

<p>The Intermountain Rate cases, discussed in the next
chapter as a phase of the long and short haul question, illustrate
even more clearly these conflicts between the court and
the Commission on matters of economics. But they introduced
no new legal technicalities. They merely emphasized
the critical nature of the controversy, so far as it concerned
the larger constitutional question of separation of powers
between the three main branches of our government.</p>

<p>The situation, as revealed by these typical cases, reduced
itself, in brief, to this: it was the same old question of broad
<i>versus</i> narrow court review all over again. The Commerce
Court held it to be its proper function, as a court of law, to
review in the broadest way all cases which came before it on
appeal. The Commission, on the other hand, maintained that
not only all matters of fact, but all inferences as to economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
facts, of necessity lay solely within the range of its own authority,
And it was certainly true that, without some such limitation
upon the right of review, the Commission might about as well
have retired from the field of regulation entirely, and contented
itself with enforcing the safety appliance laws, collecting statistics
and serving as a general publicity office.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> Fortunately
the situation promised to be saved by the line of Supreme
Court decisions flowing from the Illinois Central case.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> The
making of a rate for the future being a legislative and not a
judicial function, the power to determine that a particular
rate was or was not reasonable for the future, or that a particular
discrimination was or was not undue, was a discretionary
legislative power which could not be reviewed by the judiciary.
If the Supreme Court in due time applied this reasoning to
these later cases, the Commerce Court might confidently be
expected to take its proper place in the Federal scheme of
things. Until it was forced to do so, much of the railroad
legislation of recent years would fail to ensure that full measure
of certainty and promptitude of relief to which the country
was entitled, and which it was bound to have.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission in
1910 in the matter of freight rate advances<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> was of prime importance;
not alone because of the great monetary and commercial
interests involved, but also because it might afford a
forecast of the policy of the government in such matters in
future. Public interest was quickened also because of the
novelty of resting the burden of proof upon the railroads rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>than upon the shippers, as in the past. The effect of this
change in procedure was apparent throughout. The representatives
of the shippers were, in most cases, content to point
out the inadequacy of the reasons advanced by the carriers.
The railroads, on the other hand, were forced to come forward
aggressively with positive arguments favoring their side of
the case. The only exception to the negative task of appearing
in rebuttal against the carriers' arguments was in the somewhat
spectacular presentation of the novel issue of "scientific
management," shortly to be discussed.</p>

<p>The movement of freight rates since 1900 was insistently
upward. On two separate occasions prior to 1910, as we
have seen,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> general advances by concerted action of the carriers
took place, namely in 1903 and 1907. These earlier changes had
been mainly confined to commodity rates. All the great staples,
such as iron and steel, grain, coal and coke, glass, brick and
cement, were affected. The rate increases of 1910, on the
other hand, which gave rise to the first important test of the
Mann-Elkins law, were mainly confined to advances in class
rates,&mdash;that is to say, the rates upon merchandise and the
better grades of freight. It was doubtless true, as alleged,
that the steady decline throughout a generation before 1900
had unduly depressed the scale of charges for transportation
service; and that prices in general, and especially wages and
costs of operation, had greatly enhanced since that time. To
meet this situation, the carriers had proceeded either to get
together by an understanding not to compete; or else they had
permanently put an end to competition by downright consolidation.
After the first upward movement which paused about
1904, some time elapsed without further efforts in this direction.
Then, after postponement of a concerted attempt in 1908
matters went on quietly enough until 1910. Many changes
were unostentatiously made in individual instances by modification
of traffic rules or classification;<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> but no widespread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>action took place. The occasion for the renewal of the upward
movement in 1910 was an insistent demand of railroad employees
all over the country for a rise in wages. And the
acquiescent attitude of the railroad managers toward their
employees, suggested a tacit understanding that wages were
to be raised on condition that the brotherhoods support the
movement to recover this advance from the public through an
increase in freight rates.</p>

<p>The trunk lines filed their new tariffs in 1910, even while
Congress was in the throes of debate over the Mann-Elkins
Act. These schedules substantially increased all class rates,&mdash;by
from eight to twenty per cent;&mdash;and affected about half
the commodity rates, mainly of the lesser sort. The western
railroads promptly followed suit, filing higher tariffs by about
ten per cent, for approximately 200 commodities. In response
to vehement protest from all over the country, Congress,
as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> promptly conferred authority upon the
Interstate Commerce Commission by the Mann-Elkins amendments
to suspend such rate advances temporarily for examination
as to their reasonableness. By virtue of this authority
the Commission took testimony for several months and rendered
its decisions both for the eastern and western railroads on
February 22, 1911.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> The strongest impression which one
gains from examination of the testimony, is that the case for
the railroads was imperfectly organized and inadequately presented.
There was no division of the field in argument, with
intensive cultivation in each case; but all of the railway representatives
traversed much of the same ground, so widely scattering
their effort that but superficial treatment of each point
was possible. The shippers, on the other hand, evidently laid
out their plan of campaign with more system and had correspondingly
better results.</p>

<p>The railroads in the presentation of their case were somewhat
embarrassed by several complications, some applicable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>to all the roads alike, while others arose from the diversity of
financial and operating conditions on different lines. All
alike were denied resort to the main argument advanced in
favor of the general rate advances in earlier years, particularly
in 1900. It had been expected that stress might be laid upon
the increased cost of materials used in construction or operation;
but the fact that, largely as an aftermath of industrial
depression, prices of many commodities were actually lower
in 1910 than they had been on the average for a decade, deprived
the railroads of this powerful argument. The main
exceptions in this respect were in the prices of fuel and lumber.
Owing to the diversity of operating conditions among the
carriers, difficulty was also experienced in adducing the wage
increases of 1910 as a warrant for advancing freight rates.
Considering the entire railroad net affected, it appeared that
the augmentation in revenue from the proposed advances
would be $27,000,000; whereas the already conceded wage
increases were in excess of $34,000,000,&mdash;in each case calculations
being based upon the same volume of traffic and employment
as in the preceding year. The wage argument,
generally applied, was thus valid. But taking the carriers
one by one, it appeared that the changes in wages and revenue
which might result, varied greatly. On the New York Central,
the increase in revenue would just about cover the rise in wages;
on the Pennsylvania, it was less than half of the enlarged payroll.
It was thus apparent that emphasis upon the increase
in wages would not be equally valid for argument by all roads
alike. The possible advantage of a united front was thereby
denied.</p>

<p>Broader ground for rate increases was taken by the carriers,
in the argument that operating expenses had greatly augmented
in recent years, not so much because of higher prices or even
wages, but because of the exactions of the public in the way
either of better facilities and service or of greater safety. It
was alleged that vast expenditures had been necessarily made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
for such purposes without a commensurate increase in revenue.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
The main proof of this point lay in statistical presentation of
the greatly increased operating ratio within recent years;
that is to say, the higher percentage of gross revenue which it
was necessary to expend in operation. Here again, the carriers
failed to agree in the particular margin of safety above a
reasonable return upon the investment, paid in dividends,
which should be put back into the property. It was also urged
by the carriers that the necessary funds for constructive development
in future could be obtained only by such improvement
in railroad credit as would result from a substantial margin
of net earnings above reasonable dividends. Such were, in
the main, the arguments presented by the railroads on behalf
of their plea that the proposed rate advances should not be
suspended.</p>

<p>The case in rebuttal, as presented by representatives of
commercial organizations, was carried aggressively into the
enemy's territory in only one line of argument. It was alleged
that sufficient economy in operation could be effected by means
of "scientific management" to more than offset the increase in
wages together with the general demand for better service and
improvements by the public.<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> On the whole the arraignment
of the carriers in this regard failed to establish its point. Whatever
results from "efficiency" had been obtained in manufacturing
establishments, the limited experience in railroading
outside of shop management, while generally satisfactory,
had not been altogether convincing. Essential differences
between railroads and factories, particularly in respect of
minute supervision of labor scattered over hundreds of
miles of line, tended to render impracticable many of the improvements
in process advocated by efficiency engineers. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>demands incident to the operation of public-service companies
are also different from those applicable in private business.
Railroads must consider not only profit-making, but adequate
and satisfactory service. And, finally, the thorough organization
of labor among carriers was a bar to the untrammelled
introduction of new methods. Nevertheless, the publicity
which was derived from the presentation of this case before
the Commission could not fail to draw attention to the need
of determined and general application of such sound and
businesslike methods as were found practicable.</p>

<p>The shippers attempted, in general, to meet the railway
arguments point by point. Thus the plea of steadily increasing
operating ratios absorbing an ever larger proportion
of gross earnings, was met by statistical evidence showing that
gross revenues had so rapidly augmented during the decade as,
nevertheless, to permit of a steady increase in net revenue
year by year. In this regard, the time was certainly opportune
for establishing this point. Recovery from the depression
following 1907 was actively under way during 1909-1910.
Not even the indications that a less rosy future was to ensue
in 1911,&mdash;judged by the then course of net earnings,&mdash;sufficed
to offset statistical evidence in this regard. Even if for all the
roads taken together the wage increases would more than
absorb the increasing revenues, the fiscal year 1910 had produced
so large an increase in net earnings,&mdash;$55,000,000,&mdash;as
to still leave the carriers better off than they were before,
even without the increased freight rates for which they were
asking.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>The decisions of the Commission in both cases, covering
advances east and west, was unanimously against the railroads.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
It was held that the carriers had failed to prove their
case at practically every point. While it was true that cost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>of operation had increased for various reasons, it was also
plain that the growth of the business had more than absorbed
these additional outlays. And as to the contention that a fair
return upon the value of the property was not being earned,
the entire field of argument concerning the reasonableness of
railroad rates as related to investment, was necessarily held in
abeyance pending more positive data than was then at hand.
The decisions, however, contained a ray of hope for the carriers
in the promise that while this general increase would not be
upheld, particular changes in future would be considered on
their merits in each case.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The railroads accepted the decision
as final, and withdrew the proposed tariffs with surprisingly
little protest.<a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Whether the great increase in prices in 1912
over preceding years, operating indirectly through insistent pressure
for wage increases to enhance costs of operation, will
necessitate a reopening of this issue in a large way, seems
likely to depend upon the rate at which the volume of traffic
augments in the immediate future. It is clear, in any event,
that a sufficient surplus earning power must be permitted to
insure a continuance in favor of railway securities as compared
with other forms of investment.</p>

<p>The original long and short haul clause, as we have seen,
forbade a greater charge for a short than for a long distance over
the same line under "substantially similar circumstances and
conditions." The principal amendment in 1910 was the elimination
of this troublesome clause, "substantially similar circumstances
and conditions";&mdash;responsible, as experience had
shown for the practical nullification of the entire fourth section
of the law of 1887 through the interpretation placed upon it
in 1896 by the courts.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The insertion of a new provision in
1910 prohibiting carriers from charging "any greater compensation
as a through route than the aggregate of the intermediate
rates," concerned a somewhat different question, and may be
omitted from consideration in this connection. The Commission
was given authority under the amended law to relieve
carriers from the prohibition of the statute, which, in this
regard, did not become effective until February 17, 1911. It
was uncertain at the time how extensive was the violation of the
distance principle; although a comprehensive investigation by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>the Elkins Committee in 1905<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> showed the existence of many
irregular tariffs all over the country. Within the first ten
months after the law took effect, 5723 applications for relief
under this section were filed. Of this number only two hundred
and ninety concerned passenger fares: making it clear that the
problem was mainly one of adjustment of freight rates. Inasmuch
as the Commission held that each application should be
treated as a formal complaint to be separately passed upon, it
will be seen that these applications for relief considerably outnumbered
the total of 4570 formal complaints which had otherwise
been filed since 1887. Amendment of the fourth section
obviously imposed a heavy additional burden upon this administrative
arm of the Federal government.</p>

<p>The proposition to amend the long and short haul clause
in 1910 called forth the same divergence of opinion in Congress
as to regulation which characterized the original debate twenty
years before. One party wanted an absolute long and short
haul clause, permitting of no departure from the distance principle.
The other stood for a more elastic plan, whereby carriers
under certain economic justification should be allowed to make
a higher charge at the intermediate point. The prime difficulty
lay in defining these exceptional cases. Had Congress left
this solely to the discretion of the Commission without such
definition, the law might be held unconstitutional, as involving
a complete delegation of legislative power. The situation was
clearly stated at the time by the Chairman of the House Committee
on Interstate Commerce. "Practically what we do here
is to give the Commission power to say what, in a particular
case, shall be a just and reasonable rate; although we declare
as a general proposition that it shall be unjust and unreasonable
to charge more for a short haul than for a long haul." In brief,
it is clear that Congress intended that the general language of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
the statute should furnish the rule which the Commission was
to adopt in applying this section of the law.</p>

<p>Was there any further intention of Congress in thus amending
the long and short haul clause? The carriers contended
that the only effect was to deny the railways the right to decide
for themselves whether they might disregard the rule of the
section: in other words, that they must conform to the interpretation
laid down by the Commission itself in the Georgia
Railroad Commission cases in 1892.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> The Commission, on the
other hand, at once interpreted the amendment, as defining the
purpose of Congress differently. It held that the railroads
must assume the burden of justification. The carriers, therefore,
must become the advancing party in proving that violation
of the distance principle was warranted by the necessities
of the case. It is obvious that, without this interpretation
placed upon the amendment, Congress would not be providing
a remedy for local discrimination, but would be merely giving
power to declare the existence of a wrong.</p>

<p>The constitutionality of the amended section seemed likely
to depend upon the manner in which it was applied administratively.
If construed as conferring unrestricted power to
grant or deny applications for relief, it would probably be held
void, as already observed, as an unfettered delegation of
legislative authority. Rate making being a legislative
function, this attribute of the Congress could not constitutionally
be vested in entirety in an administrative
body. The Commission must, in other words, be restricted
and guided by certain rules and standards set by the legislature.
This point had been well established respecting the
exercise of control over the issue of capital stock by railroads
by the state commissions. It was clear, also, that the long and
short haul clause did not impose an inviolable rule to be enforced
against all carriers. This had been the contention of complainants
against the railroads in the Spokane case, soon to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
considered. It seemed clear that the proper function of the Commission
under the law, was to investigate each case by itself in
the light of the first three sections of the Act in general. After
such investigation, if it appeared that a departure from the distance
principle would result neither in unreasonable rates nor
in undue discrimination, permission therefore must be granted.
Under such circumstances it could not lawfully be withheld.
And in the contrary case deviation from the long and short
haul principle must likewise be refused.</p>

<p>The Commission in enforcing the new long and short haul
clause, in the first place laid down certain general rules for its
own guidance.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Perhaps the most important of these was that
the different rates or fares to be compared, must apply to the
same classes of transportation. It would be obviously unjust
to compare a one-way fare with either excursion or commutation
rates. Export and import freight rates, usually lower
than regular domestic rates, must each be dealt with in a class
by themselves, in determining whether the more distant point
by having a higher rate prejudiced the rights of intermediate
ones. Congress certainly did not intend to make the charging
of a commodity or carload rate in transcontinental traffic unlawful,
merely because it happened to be lower than local rates
or less-than-carload classified shipments from intermediate
points. Violation of the distance principle must properly
always be determined by comparison between rates of the same
kind. A number of similar rules were promulgated for the sake
of duly standardizing practice.</p>

<p>Applications from the carriers for exemption from the long
and short haul clause in freight tariffs fell into four distinct
groups. The largest number of petitions,&mdash;more than one-fourth
of the total filed,&mdash;had to do with the necessities of
circuitous lines in meeting through rates made over more
direct routes.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> In such cases the lowest through rate was often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>made by the longer line, which might, at the same time, conceivably
be operated at a lower cost. Permanent relief was
granted by the Commission in comparatively few of such
instances; and then only when it appeared either that the
short line had observed the distance principle throughout, or
else that the intermediate rates upon the long line were apparently
reasonable and just, in and of themselves. Under such
conditions the Commission sometimes permitted the circuitous
route, especially if it were manifestly so, to meet, not only the
prevailing rate over the short line, but also any future rate
which it might put into effect.</p>

<p>Next in importance, measured by the number of applications
for relief from the long and short haul clause in freight
tariffs, were those based upon the exigencies of market competition.
The familiar case of the rivalry of Florida and California
orange growers in the eastern markets may illustrate the situation.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
The growers must be put into that market and held
there in each case in competition with one another, each served
by the carriers who profited by their traffic. Should it be said
that because such market competition compelled a low through
rate, irrespective of distance, that no higher rate at any intermediate
point where such market competition did not exist,
should be allowed? The difficulty and danger, however, of
accepting the justification of market competition was, of course,
the fact that exemption from the distance principle might deny
to the intermediate points the advantage to which they were
justly entitled by reason of their geographical location.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> The
compelling force of market competition is exemplified also in
the transportation of pine lumber from all along the southern
tier of states to the consuming territory of the treeless Middle
West. The mills in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Texas are so much nearer than those in Florida or Georgia, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>exceptionally low rates per mile must be put in from these
latter states to enable them to hold their own. Such exceptionally
low rates, if applied to all intermediate points, would,
of course, prove ruinously unprofitable to the railroads concerned.
There were certainly contingencies of this sort entitled
to relief.</p>

<p>Closely akin to market competition in compelling departure
from the long and short haul clause, were the practices arising
in connection with commodity rates to meet special circumstances
in production or consumption. A public building,
perhaps, was to be erected at a given point; and active competition
arose from quarrymen in different parts of the country for
supplying the cut stone. A carrier serving such a quarry put
in a special carload rate in order to enable the shipper on its
line to compete for the contract. No similar commodity rates,
as a fact, were called for from intermediate stations, inasmuch
as no other quarries on the line were interested in this particular
job. The Commission ruled in such cases that no tariffs from
intermediate points need be filed, unless desired for the benefit
of some other shipper. Such cases are obviously analogous in
principle to those above mentioned under the heading of market
competition.</p>

<p>The third and perhaps, as it may appear in the future, the
most substantial ground for seeking relief from the long and
short haul clause in freight rates was the force of water competition.
For example, all along the Atlantic seaboard the low
rates of coastwise steamships were absolutely compelling in
their effect upon through rates by rail. Obviously the railroads
could not share in the business, unless they met the low water
rate,&mdash;a low water rate which, very properly, ought not to
affect the higher charges at interior intermediate points not
enjoying such competition by water. On the other hand, it
was evident that the utmost care needed to be exercised in
accepting this excuse for the lower rate at the more distant
point; or, otherwise stated, for higher rates at the intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
points not in the enjoyment of water competition. It was
unquestionable, as experience all over the country had demonstrated,
that the force of such competition upon internal waterways
had been greatly exaggerated by the railroads for their
own purposes. The steamboats had disappeared from the
Mississippi and all its branches, and from the smaller rivers of
the southern states, not because they were surpassed either
in speed or in economy, but by reason of the superior organization
and certainty of through shipments by land.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The railroad
always beat the steamboat, mainly because it was not hampered
by the difficulty of breaking bulk at transfer points. The
river boat served relatively few places, while the railroad could
make connections everywhere. And, finally, the water lines,
being open at all times to competition for the worth-while
business from rivals who needed merely to assemble enough
capital to buy a boat, could not distribute their margin of profit
according to the pressure of competition at different points
along every line.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Whether a revival of commerce upon our
inland waterways will ever change the nature of this competition
between water and land transportation remains to be seen.
But, in the meantime, it was indubitable that the plea of competition
by water required careful examination before being
accepted at its face value. The importance of this consideration
appears clearly in connection with the Intermountain rate
cases, soon to be discussed.</p>

<p>The petition of the Southern Pacific Railroad for exemption
from the prohibition of the amended long and short haul
clause in 1912,<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> as to rates between San Francisco points and
Portland, Oregon, presented a concrete problem in the fair
adjustment of distant and intermediate rates under the force of
coastwise water competition. There was no question as to the
force of this rivalry; more than three-fourths of the traffic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>between the distant seaports
moving by boat. The geographical
situation is shown by
the map herewith. But the
difficult point to decide was
as to whether the intermediate
rates were not too high by
comparison,&mdash;being made, in
other words, to compensate
unduly for the low rates and
loss of traffic at the two ends
of the line. The high intermediate
point was Talent. The
first-class San Francisco-Portland
rate for 746 miles was 51
cents per hundred pounds, as
against a San Francisco-Talent
rate for 409 miles of $1.66,&mdash;more
than three times the
charge for about one-half the
haul. Moreover, the inadequacy
of water competition as
a full explanation appeared
at many points. Albany, for
example, was no farther from
Portland than Sacramento was
from San Francisco. Yet while
Sacramento enjoyed the low
water rate north bound, neither
Albany nor other places
much nearer Portland were
given the same advantage in
southerly shipments. This
case, left open for further examination
as to facts, is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
interesting as to points at law. The carrier, as in the Intermountain
rate cases, contended that under the amended long
and short haul clause, the Commission need consider only the
force of water competition; and need not concern itself with
the reasonableness of the intermediate rates. The Commission
held this not to be a right construction of the law.</p>

<p>The reasons for seeking exception from the long and short
haul clause in passenger business, judging by the petitions filed
by carriers under the new law, had to do mainly with complications
following the establishment of mileage schedules by law
in the different states. Some of these states had also enacted
two-cent fare laws, in which case it often happened that intrastate
fares were arbitrarily higher than those which applied on
interstate business. But the main reason for seeking exemption
from the Fourth Section was the desire of circuitous routes to
meet the charges made by the short lines. Obviously, as in
freight traffic, the long line could not charge more than the short
line, and usually the short line made the rate. Practically
under such circumstances, the long line carrier could not well
maintain a higher fare to the intermediate point, since in passenger
traffic, unlike freight, the traveller could if he pleased
buy his ticket to the more distant point and then get off at the
intermediate one. The Commission, in view of this fact, naturally
found less flagrant violations of the distance principle in
passenger fares than in freight rates.</p>

<p>What economic reasons among all these advanced by the
railroads, should be accepted by the Commission as warranting
a departure from the distance principle? Originally, as we have
seen, it was held that competition either with carriers by water,
with railroads not subject to the Act, or other rare and peculiar
cases, created such dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions
as to warrant a modification of the distance principle.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> In the
first great case under the amended law, the Commission held,
more broadly, that other factors than these might properly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>taken into account. It considered itself authorized not merely
to decide whether circumstances in respect of competition at the
two points were dissimilar, but also whether, and to what extent,
that dissimilarity justified a departure from the rule. In other
words, as interpreted by the Commission, modification of the
rule might be permitted to just the degree which would seem to
be called for by consideration of the whole situation. The
best way to understand the bearing of these considerations,
however, will be to examine this first great case in detail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Intermountain rate cases, affording the first crucial test
of the long and short haul amendments of 1910, were doubly
significant. They afforded a prime example of the struggle
for supremacy between the administrative and the judicial
branches of the government. And they also stood foremost
among all the transportation controversies of the last generation.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
The grievances were long-standing. They had been
before the Interstate Commerce Commission since 1889.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> They
comprehended geographically a range of interests covering the
entire northern half of the United States. While the Rocky
mountain territory and the Pacific coast terminals were most
directly concerned, the rights in trade of every factory and distributing
point east of Denver were indirectly involved, in so
far as they participated in commerce with the Far West. Not
even the inevitable conflict over remodelling the southern basing
point system by enforcement of the new fourth section of
the Mann-Elkins law, was equal to this one, either in geographical
scope or commercial importance. And at the same time
the fact that the new Commerce Court was in 1912 on trial for
its life&mdash;this being one of its leading cases on appeal&mdash;endowed
the controversy with an even greater significance. Both in
the eyes of the law and of commerce and finance, the issue
was plainly of the first importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span></p>

<p>The transportation grievance of the tier of Rocky mountain
communities from Washington to Arizona, although simple,
divided naturally into two parts.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> The first was that the freight
rates from all eastern territory to these localities were from one-quarter
to over one hundred per cent higher than to the Pacific
coast, although the goods in transit passed their very doors and
might be hauled a distance greater by one-fourth. A carload
of glassware from Pittsburg to Spokane, Washington, paid a
freight rate of $649.44; while the charge to Seattle, four hundred
miles farther west, was only $393.60. A first-class commodity
(carload) rate from Omaha to Reno, Nevada, was $858. If the
goods were delivered 154 miles farther west, at Sacramento,
passing through Reno <i>en route</i>, the freight bill amounted to but
six hundred dollars. But this discrimination was less than half
the indictment, inasmuch as the compelling force of ocean competition
at the coast was conceded by all. It might well be that
San Francisco and its sister terminal points were unreasonably
favored, rather than that the intermountain rates were unduly
high in themselves. The carriers by land might indeed be, as
they alleged, powerless in the face of a water competition
beyond their control. And if they were thus impotent, surely
the government could not account their tariffs unlawful, however
irregular they might be.</p>

<p>The second item in the complaint of the intermountain cities
showed the cloven hoof of the transcontinental carriers. These
mountain rates, relatively so high by comparison with more
remote terminals, were equally high from every point east of
Denver over a territory two thousand miles in width.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> In
other words, entirely regardless of distance, the freight rate to
Spokane or Reno, whether from New York, Chicago, St. Paul,
Omaha, or even Denver, was the same. It was indeed a blanket
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>rate, like the fixed charge of two cents for postage. And it
made no difference how near any point in this wide zone might
be, the disparity in rates against the intermountain points
was relatively the same. Thus our two concrete examples,
above cited, were for shipments from Pittsburg and Omaha,
respectively; but in any case, were the point of origin as remote
as Portland, Maine, or even as near as Colorado "common
points," the disparity of rates was unchanged. They were
always very much higher to the intermountain cities than on to
the Pacific coast; although the carriers east of the Missouri
river got no more for their portion of the haul when the goods
were bound for Spokane than if they went on to Seattle for a
much lower through charge. This latter fact, of course, narrowed
the complaint down to the policy of the western lines.
The discrimination, if it were one, was clearly of their making.
Whatever trouble there was, originated west of the Missouri
river. However much the other railroads all over the country
might have joined in transcontinental business, they remained
impartial onlookers in this particular contest.</p>

<p>Some of the causes of the apparently abnormal western rate
adjustment are perfectly plain. The low rates to the coast were
due to water competition, which, while now under some measure
of railroad control&mdash;partially "neutralized" in fact<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>&mdash;was
always present and potentially great. It will be even more
controlling when the Panama Canal is opened.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> To meet this
situation, the carriers had established a series of through commodity
rates which practically covered all transcontinental
business. For all this traffic exposed to water competition,
it was averred, the intermountain territory was more remote,
if not geographically, at least for purposes of rate making.
The railroads consequently added the charge for the local haul
back from the coast to the low transcontinental or through rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>in determining the charge to all the intermediate cities. Thus,
they alleged, a discrimination was forced upon them, not of their
own creation. They could not grade all their intermediate
rates down to a through tariff thus fixed at the farther end.
It would mean bankruptcy. Thus far the situation is analogous
to Hadley's classic oyster car case.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The main difficulty arose
in satisfactorily explaining the second half of the scheme. How
did the blanket or "postage stamp" rate zone arise, permitting
exactly the same rates, whether to Spokane or Seattle,
from points scattered over a territory covering practically
two-thirds of the United States? Was it an artificial scheme,
modifiable at the will of the carriers or of the government;
or, like the law of gravitation, was it beyond the control of
either?</p>

<p>The truth was that westbound rates from New York, Chicago,
Omaha and St. Paul had come to be fixed at the same level,
not by water competition primarily, but by the forces of commercial
rivalry between centres bidding for the far western
market. They were originally graded somewhat according to
distance in the early days.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> And it is plain that water competition,
at first confined to the Atlantic seaboard, gradually extended
inland. In order to secure the business to San Francisco
by steamer or clipper ship, rail charges from Pittsburg or
Buffalo back to Philadelphia or New York had been absorbed
in the through rate, thus gradually extending the benefits of
water competition farther and farther west from the seaboard
cities.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> And, of course, as population and manufactures grew
in the Middle West, the narrow fringe of such competition
steadily and inexorably spread in from the Atlantic coast over
a wide zone of blanket rates, all based on New York. The
direct all-rail carriers, naturally, met this competition at all
points. Manufactures and population continued to spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>toward the West; but, imperceptibly, a new competitive factor
appeared. As the force of direct water competition lessened
with ever-widening distance inland from the Atlantic, market
competition began to gather strength. One need not go so far
as to concede that "market competition is a euphemism for
railroad policy," in order to realize that artificial rather than
natural influences gradually came to bear in the westward
extension of the blanket rate. The trans-Missouri lines, getting
the <i>whole</i> rate on shoes made in St. Louis for the Pacific
slope, while only getting a part of it if the goods came from
New England, had a direct motive to put St. Louis into the
western market and thereafter to hold it there at all cost.
Every increment in the St. Louis traffic, moreover, was surely
theirs for ever. It could not be stolen away by Canadian
railways or ocean steamship lines, as it might if it originated at
Boston. It became a settled policy of these western lines,
therefore, to meet even the water-compelled seaboard rates at
all points, no matter how far inland. The blanket zone thus
steadily widened, out of all semblance to its originally modest
proportions as based upon water competition alone. A competition
originally natural, gradually merged into another of an
entirely artificial sort.</p>

<p>The importance of both the intermountain and Pacific coast
traffic originating along the western confines of the blanket zone,
steadily increased. One record showed that three-fourths of
the business at Reno, Nevada, originated west of Chicago.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> It
all moved on the same rate as freight from Portland, Maine,
whether destined to Nevada or to the Pacific coast. The disparity
against Nevada remained absolutely the same in either
case. It was to hold this traffic, originating west of Chicago,
against all eastern competitors, that the blanket zone was so
abnormally widened by the trans-Missouri railroads.</p>

<p>For years the transcontinental rate scheme had been
before the Interstate Commerce Commission. A number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
decisions<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> were rendered prior to 1910, under the old long and
short haul clause, emasculated as it was by the Alabama Midland
decision of 1896. The Hepburn amendments of 1906 had
so far strengthened the hands of the Commission that it made
several attempts to deal with the question. But the orders
in these cases were confined to classified tonnage, although it
was clear that most of the transcontinental business moved
under commodity rates. Such carload or wholesale tonnage, of
course, was the only sort actually affected by the competition
by sea. This fact greatly aggravated the discrimination
against which the intermountain cities complained. For, in
absence of such water competition, they enjoyed relatively
fewer commodity ratings. And their youthful, though ambitious,
jobbing trade was dependent upon just such special
carload rates in competition with middlemen on the Pacific
coast. If "tin boxes and lard pails, nested" moved in
carloads, Seattle got them from "anywhere east" for a commodity
rate of eighty-five cents, as against the regular fourth-class
rate to Spokane of $1.90 per hundred pounds. The
Commission grappled with the problem of such discrimination
manfully; but made little headway until the new law of 1910
put it in better case. Then for the first time it tackled the heart
of the matter, in revising the commodity rates in the great cases
now under review. There is evidence that the railroads were
already endeavoring to remodel their tariffs, under pressure in
some degree from the Commission even before the amendment
of the law in 1910. It was recognized that some modification
of the existing scheme was needed.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> And it was relatively easy
to re-arrange mere class rates.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> They were little affected by
water competition. But the commodity schedules, concerned
in these later cases, were far more important commercially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p>Two plans were possible to mitigate the violation of the
distance principle.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The rates to intermediate points might
be lowered conformably to the long-distance standard. This
would enable the railroads to hold the coast traffic against the
water lines, but would decrease the revenues from "way"
business. Or, on the other hand, the coast rates might be put
up, regardless of water competition, in the expectation that
much through business would still go by rail. Tariffs by land
were already considerably higher than by the sea routes. Possibly
the rail rates might be increased somewhat further. Some
coast business would be lost to the water lines, but on what
remained a higher return would accrue. Moreover, a considerable
development of interior distributing centres would
be bound to ensue. And, best of all, the grievances of the
interior places would be somewhat mitigated.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Unfortunately
the Pacific coast points were in an uproar at this threat against
their supremacy in the jobbing business. And, in the meantime,
the new powers under which the present proceedings were taken
had been conferred by the Mann-Elkins law. The carriers
unaided could probably not have greatly bettered matters.
But the government, at all events, chose to deal with it; so
that these private attempts came to naught. Subsequently
such action as the carriers took, naturally assumed the form of
increases at terminals rather than reductions at intermediate
points.</p>

<p>The new orders<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> were radically different from the preceding
ones, not only in applying to commodity rates, under which
most of the tonnage really moved, but also in respect of the
form of remedy proposed. In order to correct the discrimination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>the previous decisions prescribed the absolute rates to be put
into effect at various points. The new orders did not establish
absolute rates at all, but endeavored, instead, to set up a system
of relative rates or differentials. All the former decisions
had held the intermountain rates inherently unreasonable.
The new opinions treated them as only relatively so. A clear
distinction was drawn between real water competition and that
<i>pseudo</i> water competition which, as has been said, resolved
itself practically into a mere competition of markets with one
another. The guiding principle adopted was that the force of
water competition,&mdash;the only one entirely beyond the carriers'
control,&mdash;of necessity increased with the proximity of the
shipping-point to the Atlantic seaboard. Business from New
York to Seattle by rail had to go at rates compelled by the rivalry
of steamship lines. Traffic from Omaha to Reno, Nevada,
was surely free from it. Yet under the then existing system
no distinction whatever was made between the two sets of
circumstances. All rates were blanketed, regardless of remoteness
from the eastern seaports. The new governmental order
substituted a series of zones suggestive of those so long prevalent
in trunk line territory.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> These are shown by the map on
page <a href="#Page_618">618</a>. As one passed westward from zone IV, with water
competition under full pressure at New York, the influence of
the roundabout carriers by sea progressively diminished; until,
at last, beyond the Missouri it became <i>nil</i>. Such water competition
affording the only pretext for a grant of lower rates to
the Pacific terminals than to intermountain points, it followed,
logically, that the disparity in charges between such interior and
coastal places should decrease <i>pari passu</i> with the westward
movement of the originating point. A substantially lower rate
from New York to San Francisco than from New York to
Nevada might be permitted; but no such difference, relatively,
ought to obtain from St. Paul or Omaha to San Francisco as
compared with Rocky mountain territory. For these inland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>initial points were practically beyond the range of steamship
rivalry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 697px;">
<img src="images/illus636.jpg" width="697" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Specifically, the Commission in these orders forbade any
higher charge to the mountain points from any part of zone I
than applied to the Pacific terminals. From zone II, lying
four hundred miles more to the east, there would probably
never be any considerable traffic coming back to New York
in order to go round by sea, but in rare instances there might
be some. From this zone, therefore, intermountain rates might
be not more than seven per cent. above those to the Pacific
terminals. And so on as one went east. Rates from zone III
might be not more than fifteen per cent. higher to Spokane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
than to Seattle. From zone IV to Rocky mountain territory
they might be twenty-five per cent, above those to San Francisco;
but the disparity against the intermountain territory,
even from here with water competition in full effect, must
never exceed this percentage.</p>

<p>This ingenious plan certainly commends itself in principle
to the economic student. It restored in a measure the gradations
existing in 1887.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> It did not create the zones out of whole
cloth. It utilized a scheme for division of territory already
adopted by the transcontinental lines for other purposes.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
And, most important of all, it was elastic, not prescribing absolute
rates, but resting content with laying emphasis upon the
need of gradation. Yet it granted a substantial measure of
relief from the present disparity of rates. For, whereas the
former intermountain tariffs from the East were from fifty to
one hundred per cent, above those to the Pacific coast, the
difference under this order might never exceed twenty-five per
cent. The new scheme was cleverly planned, also, from a legal-strategic
point of view. It could scarcely be attacked under
the Fourteenth Amendment as confiscatory, inasmuch as it
left so much latitude to the carriers in the readjustment of their
tariffs.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> To overset it on this ground, they must prove that
disaster would result from the particular rates which they
had chosen to adopt. This would be an impossible task. The
only choice remaining to the carriers, therefore, would be to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>attack the order on the ground that the Commission was exceeding
its powers, delegated by Congress. This, in effect,
was what was done.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>The opinion of the Commerce Court,<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> setting aside the
intermountain rate orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
will shortly be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the
United States, to which tribunal appeal was promptly taken.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
Disregarding the dissenting opinion that the entire long and
short haul clause, as amended in 1910, was unconstitutional, there
were three significant differences between the two tribunals.</p>

<p>The first point at issue between the court and the Commission
concerned the differentiation of water competition from
so-called market competition.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> The Commerce Court refused
to recognize any distinction between the cause of lower rates to
the Pacific coast from Omaha or from New York, respectively.
It ascribed the disparity in all cases to competitive forces
entirely beyond the railroads' control "If the carrier from St.
Paul, in order to meet new water competition from New York,"
etc. The Commission, on the other hand, clearly set apart
market competition, applicable to western cities, from that
due to carriage by water, which controlled rates from the Atlantic
seaboard. The railways, it said, must conform in their rate-making
policies to the latter. They were not bound by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>former. For market competition (as already quoted) "is a
euphemism for railroad policy."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> And, speaking as an economist,
ignorant of the technicalities of the law, I venture to
affirm that the Commission in this contention was absolutely
right.<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> Even as far west as South Bend, Indiana, wagons may
go to California by the direct rail route; or, with a change of
ten cents in the rate, they may come back to New York and
thence go round by sea. Such is the delicacy of adjustment
even as far west as Chicago. Hence the failure to recognize
that low rates to the Pacific coast from points west of the
Missouri river were due to an entirely different cause&mdash;namely,
the arbitrary determination of the transcontinental lines to
hold the fort for their local clients against all odds&mdash;was to
commit an egregious economic blunder. Furniture goes from
Chicago to San Francisco on rates as low as if compelled by water
competition.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> But steamships never carry commodities of
this bulky sort, even from New York. How much less, then,
could water competition apply so far inland? The carriers
were bent on keeping Chicago in the Pacific market. That
was the real reason. The Commerce Court clearly missed the
main point.</p>

<p>Equally sound economic evidence that water competition
alone was not responsible for the entire present transcontinental
rate system, was afforded by the fact that the wide blanket zone,
already described, covering two-thirds of the United States for
westbound rates, found no counterpart in the scheme under
which rates were made up in the opposite direction.<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> It is a
poor rule which will not work both ways. And surely water
competition, when present, should be potent in either direction.
It was undeniable that the absence of pushing cities along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span>Pacific slope, desirous of developing trade relations with the
Atlantic states, discouraged even the slightest extension of terminal
rates inland. The ironclad monopoly enjoyed by the
Harriman and Hill lines would probably have prevented this in
any event. But the significant point was that there was no
demand for a blanket zone for eastbound traffic. Hence water-compelled
rates staid where they belonged; that is to say, closely
confined to the Pacific seaboard cities. Thus it would also
have been in the eastern half of the country, had it not been
for "market competition"&mdash;this artificial factor which the
Commerce Court failed utterly to recognize as in a class by
itself.</p>

<p>The second vital difference of opinion between the Commerce
Court and the Commission was economico-legal. The economist
in the office of critic here stands upon less firm ground. And
yet, whatever the law may be, the reasoning rests upon the
interpretation of the facts.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The Commerce Court held that
"when the rate for the longer haul is forced unreasonably low
by competition, the only elements that can enter into the consideration
of the rate for the shorter haul are its reasonableness,"
etc.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The controlling idea, in other words, in the reviewing
judicial mind, was that, so long as the rate at Spokane or Reno
was reasonable <i>in itself</i>, it was a matter of indifference to that
locality what rate might be made to Seattle. All that the
Commerce Court needed to do, therefore, was to consider the
"intrinsic reasonableness"<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> of the intermediate rate. Not so,
held the Commission. Whether this charge was reasonable
or not was a question of relativity. It depended upon what
rate was made to other points all around it and competitive
with it. In other words, the intermediate could not be dissociated
from the long-distance point. Railroads as public carriers
owed a common duty to both points. No intermediate rate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>however low <i>per se</i>, could be reasonable, if the carrier was voluntarily
offering a lower rate to points beyond. If its lower rate
beyond was accorded under compulsion, that of course was a
different matter. But in so far as these low Pacific terminal
rates were due to an artificial railroad policy, any discrimination
against the nearer points was unwarranted.</p>

<p>The analogy is clear between this difference of opinion of
Commission and court and that between the two schools which
would base judicial determination of rates in general upon inherent
or relative reasonableness, respectively. The "remuneration"
test, which the carriers' representatives sought to insert
in the law of 1906, seeks to discover innate reasonableness of
rates; not affected, that is to say, by the revenue which may
accrue from them in the aggregate. The other standard declares
such reasonableness to be always dependent upon circumstances;
notably upon the amount of the investment and
the resultant earning power arising out of the volume of business
carried at the rates in question.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>The third difference of opinion between court and Commission
was purely one of law.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Had the latter exceeded its
powers delegated by Congress in attempting to fix a <i>relation</i> of
rates, instead of prescribing certain maximum rates applicable to
particular points?<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> The reasoning followed was apparently
derived from the Supreme Court opinion in the Chattanooga
case.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> This reasoning, the government now contended in its
argument on appeal to that tribunal, was inapplicable to the
since amended law. Limits of space and the natural diffidence
of an economist, alike forbid extended discussion of this nice
point at law. The Commission alleged that, except by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>exercise of such authority to prescribe relativity of rates, it
would be powerless to remedy such discriminations in future.
In consequence, inasmuch as Congress evidently intended to
enable it to afford such remedy, authority over relativity of
rates must be derived by necessary implication. And it is
certain, economically speaking, that in this position the Commission
was once more perfectly right. Whether it was legally
so remained yet to be decided.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> In this connection, it seems
odd that none of the briefs for the government mentioned an
important instance of the undisputed exercise of such power to
establish relativity of rates. The Commission had for years,
even in absence of any express authorization by law until 1910,
freely prescribed details of freight classification in a large
number of important cases.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> It had never done more than to
fix relativity; and the constitutionality of its orders had never
been attacked.</p>

<p>An entirely new issue arose at this point. Prescribing
relativity of rates implied determination of minimum rates.
For if, as in this transcontinental case, the freight rate to
Nevada points from New York might never be more than
twenty-five per cent. greater than to San Francisco, a lower
limit as well as an upper one was thereby prescribed for the
latter point, and <i>vice versa</i>. The rate to one point once fixed
by the carrier, voluntarily if you please, the minimum rate to
the other might be necessarily determined thereby. If a dollar
rate prevailed at Spokane, the Seattle rate must not fall below
seventy-five cents. Was this not something new? Did it not
suggest fixing, not maximum rates alone, but absolute rates as
well? And if an attempt to fix absolute rates, was it not unconstitutional?
There could be no two minds about the need of
conferring power upon the Interstate Commerce Commission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>over minimum or differential rates, if effective government
regulation were ever to be attained. This had been my contention
for years.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> It had the best possible expert support
from the side of the carriers.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Discriminatory rates could never
be corrected until such power was delegated by Congress or
conferred by judicial interpretation of the law. Kansas City
now enjoys lower rates to Chicago on packing-house products
than are accorded to Omaha. On every sound principle of rate
making, the two cities ought to be placed on a parity. But the
Commission could not rectify the abuse; for the roads from Kansas
City promptly reduced their rates <i>pari passu</i> with any reduction
of the charge at Omaha.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> There was no bed rock below
which rates could not go. The Omaha railroads as well as the
government were powerless in face of the situation.</p>

<p>May power to fix minimum rates, so necessary to an adequate
program of control, be constitutionally delegated by Congress?
The question has never been squarely presented to the
Supreme Court.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> But the language in many cases has been
such as to indicate that maximum rates alone may be lawfully
established. Is the reiteration of the word "maximum" intentional?
Or may it be that the judicial mind has never yet contemplated
the need of regulating the minimum rate? Surely
it seems an anomaly that the government should ever seek to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>fix such a lower limit, <i>below</i> which compensation may not be
had. And yet many cases show that it is absolutely necessary,
to the end that justice may be done. Or may the unconstitutionality
of fixing minimum rates depend upon the fact that, if
thus prescribed along with maximum rates, it will amount,
practically, to determination of the absolute rate&mdash;the bogey
which the carriers seem most of all to hold in dread? Interesting
and inviting possibilities of judicial interpretation are indeed
suggested along this line, were there opportunity to pursue
them further.</p>

bodies pending the Supreme Court decisions was filed June 18, 1912. It is
estimated to save Spokane shippers alone about $500,000 annually. Class
rates are the Commission's from the seaboard, but from interior points are
somewhat lower. The acceptance of the distance principle is the significant
point.
</p>
<p>
"As the distance, St. Paul to Spokane, approximately 1500 miles, is
150 per cent. of the distance Omaha to Salt Lake, approximately 1000 miles,
a reasonable rate from St. Paul to Spokane would not be less than 130
per cent. of the rate from Missouri river to Salt Lake, and in the proposed
tariff rates from St. Paul to Spokane would be made accordingly.
</p>
<p>
"From Mississippi common points as defined by current tariffs, the
rates would be 112&frac12; per cent. of the St. Paul rates.
</p>
<p>
"From Chicago and common points, the rates would be 116-2/3 per cent.
of St. Paul rates.
</p>
<p>
"From Detroit and common points, 125 per cent. of the St. Paul rates.
</p>
<p>
"From Buffalo, Pittsburg and common points, 130 per cent. of St.
Paul rates.

"From New York, Boston and common points, 130 per cent. of St.

<p>Historically, the attempt of the separate American states
to control railways began with a law after the English model
in New Hampshire establishing a commission in 1844.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Three
other New England states then followed suit prior to the
Civil War.<a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> But these early experiments were mainly concerned
with matters of safety rather than of rates. The first
real step was taken by Massachusetts in 1869. The Railroad
Commission created in that year has served ever since as a
model of the so-called "weak" or "advisory" type of regulation.
Others of this sort were more common in the eastern
states. Such commissions, in Massachusetts for example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>rely mainly upon public opinion for the enforcement of their
decisions. They possess very limited authority over rates,
although they are empowered to recommend such changes as
may be deemed advisable. Back of this authority, of course,
lies the legislative power of the General Court, invoked on
special occasions. But, in general, the activities of the Massachusetts
type of commission have been mainly confined to
supervision, either of construction or of capitalization.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> New
York and several other states conformed in the main to this
type, although none of them had any authority over matters
of finance. A second variety of the older railroad commissions
dates from the period of the Granger Movement in the West.
Maximum rate laws were passed by a number of commonwealths
in the seventies, notably Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and
Wisconsin. The outcome of this legislation was the decision of
the Supreme Court of the United States, elsewhere discussed,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
holding that state legislatures had the power to fix rates. The
so-called "strong" commissions had their rise in connection
with these events. Railway boards of this second type exercised
control over rates in two ways; namely, by means of the promulgation
of freight classifications and the prescription of maximum
distance tariffs. For the purposes of such regulation most of
the western states grouped the carriers according to their
earning capacity, with a different schedule in each case. In
certain of the southern states these older commissions adopted
even more drastic policies which brought about prolonged
litigation. The peculiar case of Texas, adding financial legislation
to the direct prescription of rate schedules, has been
discussed by itself.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>A new chapter in railroad regulation by the separate states
dates from the general public unrest and Congressional activity
of the Roosevelt period. An almost frenzied activity after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[Pg 629]</a></span>1900 culminated in 1907 in a legislative wave which swept
over the entire country. No less than fifteen new or remodelled
commissions were created in the two years 1905-1907, bringing
the total number by 1908 to thirty-nine. Practically all of
these were of the so-called "strong" type; that is to say,
possessing the most extensive powers over all matters of rate
operation and in many cases of finance as well. The most
notable of these, of course, were the so-called Public Utility
Commissions of Wisconsin (1905) and New York (1907).
The subjugation of the formerly dominant railway interests in
New Jersey and Pennsylvania was also highly significant.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
The movement even invaded the New England States,&mdash;so
long a sanctuary of the "weak" or advisory commission.
Vermont and New Hampshire set up powerful boards, and
Massachusetts, in 1913, amplified the powers of its commission
in harmony with the general movement. Several
features of this new lot of state commissions contrast markedly
with even the old-fashioned "strong" type. Many of them
permit the fixing of absolute rates. The majority now provide
for appointment rather than election of the commissioners;
and also by salary and in other ways enhance the dignity of
the office. This operates naturally to lift these boards out of
a semi-political atmosphere formerly too characteristic in
many cases; and to bring them more to a par with the state
courts.</p>

<p>The "Wisconsin Idea," achieving its full flower under the
remarkable leadership of Governor La Follette in 1905, ably
seconded by a number of prominent University of Wisconsin
men, notably Hon. B. H. Meyer, now a member of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, most completely realizes the
progressive policy of sane state regulation.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> The principle is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>laid down "that it was as much the duty of the state to furnish
transportation facilities as it ever had been to make roads or
build bridges; and that if the function was delegated to any
one, it was the duty of the state to regulate it so that the agent
should be required to furnish adequate service, reasonable
rates, and practise no discrimination." And, it is added, that
this procedure should be "so simple that a man can write his
complaint on the back of a postal card, and if it is a just one,
the state will take it up for him." The three fundamental
principles of the Wisconsin programme, now happily incorporated
in the Federal law, were full authority over future rates;
secured without expense to the complainant; and with the
burden of proof laid upon the railroad in cases of appeal. In
short, the Wisconsin plan provided for thoroughgoing administrative
control, that is to say, with strict limitation of judicial
review to the determination of points at law. The issues were
in no wise different from those already discussed heretofore
in connection with the development of the recent Federal
policy; except possibly in respect of the persistency of opposition,
which has had to be overcome more gradually in the
Senate of the United States,&mdash;the natural stronghold of
corporate influence.</p>

<p>The creation of powerful state commissions since 1905 has,
oddly enough, been accompanied by a great activity of the
state governments in the enactment of statutes aiming independently
to regulate common carriers. Laws of this class
are not new. As far back as 1890 there were twenty-two maximum
rate and fare statutes. A period of quiescence, marked
by only four such laws in twelve years, was followed by the
passage within five years to 1907 of no less than twenty-two
maximum fare laws and nine maximum rate schedules.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> To
these may be added a large grist of statutes dealing with almost
every detail of operation or service. Demurrage, provision
for terminals, train service and connections, distribution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>cars, industrial and spur tracks, and hours of labor, may be
cited among a host of others.</p>

<p>The activities of state governments in recent years in the
creation of powerful railroad commissions, with the added grist
of drastic independent statutes, have greatly emphasized the
eternal conflict of authority between the state and Federal
governments, as well as between the different states. Problems
akin to those raised by the diversity of our laws respecting
marriage, labor, and bankruptcy have been forced upon the
attention of Congress and the Federal courts. Reasonable
co&ouml;peration might be counted upon to accomplish something;
but the course of events since 1905 points to the necessity of a
final settlement of this important issue as far as common
carriers are concerned, so authoritatively that a greater measure
of political and industrial peace may prevail in future. The
situation respecting railroads was well described by Justice
McKenna of the United States Supreme Court in an opinion
annulling the North Carolina law requiring railroads to receive
goods for interstate transportation whether they had published
rates for the proposed shipment or not;&mdash;"if the carrier obeys
the state law, he incurs the penalty of the Federal law; if he
obeys the Federal law, he insures the penalty of the state law.
Manifestly, one authority must be paramount, and when it
speaks, the other must be silent." It may be added that in
this recent case, following the inevitable trend of events it
was the state law upon which the penalty of silence was
visited.</p>

<p>The ultimate ramifications of a state law under the complexities
of modern railway rate adjustment and operation can
never be foreseen. It is not simply a question of avoiding
conflict between distance tariffs and classifications.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[Pg 632]</a></span>times
the most modest rules and regulations may lead to results
affecting commerce over a wide area. The great increase in
large cars throughout the West, by contrast with other parts
of the country, as traceable to the establishment by Missouri
of minimum carloads,<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> is a case in point. We have also already
observed how the revised milk laws of Massachusetts opened
up an issue covering all of New England.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> And then there are
the various attempts of the railroad commissions, notably
Texas<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> and Minnesota, to set up schemes of rates which shall
concentrate the distributive business of the community in local
cities as against the competition of jobbers at a distance. The
extreme confusion introduced in matters of classification by conflicting
authorities has already reached a point where demand
for the substitution of a single uniform schedule for the United
States has become wellnigh irresistible.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> There are also conflicts
respecting laws regulating service, illustrated by the Supreme
Court decision in 1907, holding that the attempt of North
Carolina to require through fast mail trains to stop at small
way stations, was unconstitutional;<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> and finally, some agreement
as to division of accounts between interstate and intrastate
business will at once be recognized as an essential to the
determination of reasonable rates for through and local service
respectively.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> From every side, in short, the need of a clear
separation of state and Federal powers is becoming more and
more insistent.</p>

<p>The conflict between general and local authority came to
a head in 1907, resulting in a violent clash between the Federal
and state courts.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> The worst complication arose in the South,
particularly in North Carolina and Alabama. Certain rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>roads
brought suit in the Federal courts to annul rates fixed
by the state legislatures; and temporary Federal injunctions
were at once issued suspending the statutes until determination
of their constitutionality. Popular feeling was much aroused,
and local officials sought vigorously to defend states' rights.
Ticket agents collecting more than the state-prescribed fare,
were condemned to the chain gang and the president of the railroad
company was arrested. Federal judges promptly released
all parties by writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>. A truce was finally patched
up, pending determination of the matter at issue by the Supreme
Court of the United States. The final and inevitable
outcome, of course, was a decision by this tribunal, upholding
the authority of the general government.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Technically, the
question in these cases concerned the power of the Federal
courts to issue temporary injunctions suspending state laws;
or, in other words, raising the nice distinction as to whether
a suit against a state officer was a suit against the state or not.
Various other legal technicalities were involved both in North
Carolina and Alabama. The main issue has been dealt with
for the future by a special clause of the Mann-Elkins law of
1910. This provides that a petition for an injunction suspending
a state law, shall be heard by three Federal judges,
one at least of a superior court. Five days' notice is required;
and there is a direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States. But an injunction, thus issued, is given clear precedence
over any statute regarding common carriers emanating
from authority of an individual state.</p>

<p>The state of Missouri has had a trying experience. This
occurred in connection with a statute of 1907 reducing passenger
rates from three to two cents a mile. Federal judges
promptly granted injunctions against the enforcement of this
statute. The state's Attorney-General in the meantime cited
the railroads into the state courts to show cause for failing to
obey. The compromise in this case took the form of an agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
to give the new law a trial of several months in order to
test the financial effect of the reduction in fares. Then followed
an interchange of injunctions, quite characteristic of the
old days of the Erie Railroad, save for the integrity of the judges
concerned. To this there then succeeded a decision by the
Federal Circuit Court that the rates were confiscatory; although
for some reason the two-cent fares and other reduced
charges remained practically in effect. Controversies similar
to this have arisen since 1907 in some seven different states.
Oregon and West Virginia took issue as to the validity of two-cent
passenger fare laws. In the latter case, the state supreme
court held that the statute was not confiscatory. In Oregon
the lower Federal court upheld the state law. The contest
from Kentucky involved the constitutionality of a state railroad
commission act, already held unconstitutional in the
United States Circuit Court. The Arkansas appeal had
mainly to do with maximum rate laws in relation to physical
valuation of property; and in Ohio, the validity of a state
rate on coal to Lake Erie was in dispute. The railroad contended
that the traffic was interstate commerce, a contention
denied by the state authorities.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> The Minnesota case,&mdash;perhaps
the most voluminous in its record of all,&mdash;had primarily
to do with the confiscatory nature of reductions of intrastate
rates: and this in turn hinged upon the mode of separating
accounts.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> A distinct affirmation of Federal supremacy has
also been had by a Circuit Court opinion in 1911. All these
cases are at this writing (1912) before the Supreme Court of
the United States for decision. The main issue is pooled by
agreement between the governors of the seven commonwealths
concerned. The outcome cannot fail to be of the utmost
importance,&mdash;far-reaching in its effect not only upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span>regulation of railways but throughout the entire field of constitutional
law. Such decisions as the Supreme Court has
already rendered in connection with these matters having
been entirely favorable to Federal authority, undoubtedly in
this instance induced the joint action of the state executives
for mutual protection and support. There can be no doubt
that a sweeping decision, upholding Federal authority, will
go far to solidify control by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
It will also clear the air and greatly simplify the problem
of operation by the managements of the railroads, not only in
these seven states but all over the United States as well.</p>

<p>The delicate balance between state and Federal authority
over commerce is also in a way to be tested in what promises
to become an historic case before the Interstate Commerce
Commission,&mdash;historic in the sense that its final adjudication
by the Supreme Court of the United States will add a positive
contribution to the body of our fundamental law.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> It may
best be understood by first gaining a clear idea of the nature
of the economic grievance. Shreveport, Louisiana, is situated
on the Red river, an important tributary of the Mississippi,
some 190 miles distant from Dallas and 231 miles from Houston,&mdash;both
of the latter being important and ambitious
provincial distributing points in Texas. Shreveport, enjoying
the benefits of water competition,&mdash;probably more keen
historically than at present,&mdash;was granted correspondingly
low carload rates by rail on merchandise from the north and
east. These favorable rates were not extended to the two
Texas cities, inasmuch as water competition was entirely absent.
Naturally, therefore, an advantage was given to the Louisiana
city in competition for distributive business in all the intermediate
territory and even over in the <i>Hinterland</i> in Texas.
In pursuance of a long-standing policy of encouraging the
growth of provincial jobbing points within its own borders,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</a></span>the Texas Railroad Commission proceeded to overcome this
disability by prescribing relatively low rates out of Dallas and
Houston as compared with the rates from Shreveport to the
same points. It seems even to have gone further and to have
interposed positive barriers against the competition of Shreveport
jobbers in Texas territory, by somewhat more than
compensating for the low water rates at Shreveport. The disparity
thus set up may be best illustrated by the following
table of charges for approximately equal distances.</p>

<p>Stated in another way, sixty cents would carry one hundred
pounds of first-class traffic some 160 miles out of Dallas into
eastern Texas; while an equal rate out of Shreveport into the
same Texas territory, west bound, was exacted for a haul of
only fifty-five miles,&mdash;about one-third the distance.</p>

<p>The Commission decided upon the evidence by a bare
majority that these Texas tariffs were unduly preferential;
and ordered them to be so readjusted that the charges should
be the same for equal distances from all three cities regardless
of state lines. Concerning the minor point that it was lawful
for a carrier to equalize conditions as between two competing
places by imposing high local rates upon one point in order to
offset the advantages as to inbound through rates enjoyed by
the other, the Commission merely re-affirmed its belief that
natural advantages of geographical location could not lawfully
thus be nullified.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>The opinion rendered in this case is remarkable, less in its
economic aspects, concerning which there seems not to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
been any great diversity of view, than as regards the divergent
views expressed as to the legal authority of the Commission
to interfere in the matter at all. Was undue preference and
advantage in the eyes of the law,&mdash;the decision being rendered
under the third section of the act,&mdash;created by the set of circumstances
above described? At this point the Commission
divided, with no fewer than two concurring and two dissenting
opinions added to the majority view. According to this last,
not only was the power of Congress to legislate in such matters
paramount, but it was also held that this supreme power to
put an end to all forms of local discrimination,&mdash;even those
created by the act of state authorities,&mdash;had been delegated
by Congress to the Interstate Commerce Commission. And
in such instances, wherein conflict arose between Federal
and state authority, the only rational and possible course, it
was held, was for the national government through its administrative
agent "to assume its constitutional right to
lead."</p>

<p>The three separate dissenting opinions are of interest as
expressing the need of a definitive pronouncement upon this
great question by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Not alone as to whether Congress intended to delegate authority
to the Commission to settle such issues, but even the right of
Congress itself to pass upon them under the Federal constitution,
were called in question by the members of this administrative
board. Two dissenters were content to submit the
matter to "the august tribunal of the people which is continually
sitting" to choose between submitting to such grievances
as an alternative for virtually legislating state authority
out of existence. The third dissentient view was more thoroughgoing.
It not only discovered, legally speaking, no undue
discrimination in the circumstances. It pointed out that on
reducing the Shreveport local tariff "we fix interstate rates
by the Texas yardstick," whereby "the national government
therefore <i>leads</i> by <i>following</i>." It concluded by affirming that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
the Commission "should confine itself within the four corners
of the law of its creation, usurping neither the legislative
function of the Congress nor the judicial power of the courts."
From all of which it is clear, first, that the Supreme Court of
the United States, having once clearly defined the jurisdiction
of the Federal government in such matters, it may, in the
second place, well be that further amendment of the Act to
Regulate Commerce will be in order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In conclusion, it is pertinent, apropos of the approaching
completion of the Panama Canal and the intensified interest
in a more complete utilization of our internal waterways, to
discuss briefly the relation between railroads and carriers by
boat. The most stupendous canal projects are being brought
forward, in the expectation that they will not only provide
for a vast amount of low-grade traffic in themselves, but also
that through the forces of competition they will bring about
a substantial lowering of charges by railway. The most ambitious
of these enterprises is the plan for a "Lakes to the
Gulf" ship canal, even comprehending the dream of a twenty-four
foot channel down the course of the Mississippi. Another
and more modest proposition, probably practicable, is the construction
of a canal from Lake Erie to the Ohio river. Altogether
it has been credibly estimated<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> that the entire scheme
for internal improvements of this sort would call for an outlay
of not less than $2,000,000,000. Before engaging in any
experiments upon such a magnificent scale, it is certainly
proper to enquire whether the results will be in any way commensurate
with their cost.</p>

<p>The cost of water carriage, like that of transportation by
rail, should at the outset be divided into two distinct parts;
one of which varies more or less in proportion to the volume of
traffic, while the other, concerned with fixed charges on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
investment, maintenance and depreciation, is constant. The
latter in other words bears little or no relation to the tonnage
transported.<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> A careful distinction between these two great
groups of expenditures is of fundamental importance in any
comparison between rail and water carriage. The failure to so
distinguish is responsible for much of the fallacious reasoning
upon the subject both in and outside of the halls of Congress.
It is indisputable that mere operating expenses are very much
less by boat than by rail, especially when the economies of
large craft can be had. The phenomenal development of
commerce upon the Great Lakes, especially for the carriage of
iron ore, coal and lumber, is due to this fact.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> But, on the
other hand, it is equally clear that the second great group of
expenditures, particularly the fixed charges due to the enormous
first cost of construction, are very much greater by artificial
waterways than by rail. The balance between low operating
costs and heavy fixed charges, of course, will be struck according
to the nature of the particular enterprise. And canals,
being entirely artificial, offer the least advantageous opportunity
for realization of the economies incident to movement
of freight by water.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>Improved riverways are economical by comparison with
canals just in proportion to their lessened first cost; but, on
the other hand, mere movement expenses, maintenance and
depreciation are apt to be higher according to the strength of
the current. In each instance everything depends upon first
cost and the consequent burden of fixed charges. This point
is almost totally neglected in popular discussion of the subject.
Internal waterways being, without exception, public enterprises,
the burden of interest charges is generally put aside
as of no consequence. Naturally therefore, these being eliminated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>the apparent economy of carriage by water is mirrored
forth with great effect.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>The experience of Germany, so often adduced in favor of
water carriage, when examined in the light of the foregoing
economic principles, is peculiarly illuminating. Much traffic,
to be sure, moves apparently with greater cheapness than by
rail upon both canals and rivers. Considering the tariffs
which are based upon movement expenses alone, excluding,
that is to say, any adequate return upon the total investment,
such methods of transportation seem very economical and
highly effective. But when <i>total</i> costs, rather than merely
partial ones, are considered, the picture is completely reversed.
The Dortmund-Ems canal, for instance, certainly the most
important in Germany, represents an investment per mile
fifty per cent. greater than the average for German railways.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
For the single year 1905, the contributions from the states and
cities interested, amounted to a subsidy of about $900,000.
This financial burden, if distributed over the total tonnage,
would make the entire cost of operation nearly one-fourth
greater than the average by rail.</p>

<p>Rivers, as we have seen, possess certain advantages over
canals, mainly in proportion to the lessened first cost of their
improvement. The Rhine is often cited as an example of what
the Mississippi should be as a great channel of commerce; but
again that fatal objection of the first cost and, in the case of
the Mississippi, of maintenance must always be kept in mind.
The Rhine like the Hudson river or the St. Lawrence is, indeed,
naturally adapted for carriage by water. Its firm banks,
gentle gradient and constancy of level, are all elements in its
favor. But it is certainly futile to anticipate similar results
on the Mississippi or its tributaries,&mdash;huge and inconstant
leviathans as they are, traversing a great alluvial plain devoid
of solid foundations of any sort. The fact that today with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span>nine foot channel, Pittsburg makes no use of the Ohio river
for its shipments of iron and steel, but sends them to the Pacific
coast by way of New York, certainly does not augur well for
the success of even an enlarged riverway in future, except
possibly as to coal. Of course, if the government is to write
off all the original investment, shifting the incidence to the
general taxpayers of the country, that is a different matter.
But unless the state thus chooses to subsidize the enterprise
entirely, the total cost of transportation by rail will continue
to be in future as it has been in the past, substantially lower
than by the older and now antiquated methods of transportation.
If the end in view be the attainment of the lowest possible
rates, why not subsidize the railroads directly by this same
amount? or even buy them up and operate them for cost?
The expense to the taxpayers would be no more; and this
plan would unquestionably give far better results. Even the
electrically-towed canal boat is not to be compared for efficiency
in reaching all parts of the country without transhipment,
with giant locomotives, low grades, heavy rails and large train
loads.</p>

<p>The ownership or control of water carriers by railroads
constitutes a troublesome feature of present day conditions.
Peculiar prominence, legislatively speaking, was given to it
because of the attempt in 1912 to combine legislation dealing
with this possible evil with the matter of Panama Canal tolls
and regulations. Such control of water lines in competition
with railways is matter of public record.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Much of the coastwise
traffic is thus tied up. The Long Island sound service
of the New Haven system, the Old Dominion Company, jointly
owned by eastern railroads, and the Morgan Line and Pacific
Mail Company, both parts of the Southern Pacific system, are
notable instances. The same thing is true upon the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>Lakes, where a practical monopoly of eastbound transportation
has been long held by the trunk lines. By refusal to grant
through routes and joint rates to the Lake lines at Buffalo,
these railroads have practically throttled the independent
water service.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> Even on the lesser rivers this phenomenon of
neutralization of water competition occurs. Oftentimes where
the bulk of the tonnage, as in transcontinental business, moves
by rail, the water lines simply follow the railroads as to rates
with a modest differential dependent upon circumstances. But
the fact of practical elimination of competition by boat line
is well recognized.</p>

<p>The concrete shape in which this matter arose in Congress
was in the form of amendments to the Panama Canal law of
1912. In the House a bill providing for free passage of all
American coastwise vessels was passed by a vote of 206 to 61,
this measure at the same time prohibiting all railroads from
owning stock in or otherwise controlling directly or indirectly,
any competing steamship lines. The overwhelming non-partisan
majority is significant of public sentiment on the
question. The Senate took a less radical stand in limiting the
prohibition of railroad ownership to vessels making use of
the Panama Canal. After prolonged discussion in the conference
committee, the more drastic measure was, fortunately,
eliminated.</p>

<p>From several points of view absolute prohibition of financial
relationship between railway and water carriers seems
unwise. A practical objection is that it may seriously handicap
American roads in competition with Canadian carriers. The
Grand Trunk, for example, reaching tidewater on Long Island
sound might lawfully operate a boat line extending its service
into New York; whereas the New Haven Railroad would be
forced to dispose of its water lines to the same point, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
they were in competition with its railroad service. And it is
indisputable that similar injustice to American railroads might
elsewhere be brought about. Moreover, the undoubted evil
of water competition thus neutralized by railroads, might be
remedied in other ways. One of these, embodied in recommendations
of the Port Directors of Boston in 1912, opposing
the more drastic legislation above mentioned, is the prevention
of monopoly through public ownership or control of docks
and wharfs. For railway ownership or lease of these, as at
Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston and elsewhere, is one of
the easiest methods of preventing water competition. The
water lines find it physically impossible to secure suitable
terminals. And then, finally, there is always the possibility
under the now amplified Interstate Commerce law, of enforcing
both reasonable rates and facilities for through shipments,
part rail and part water, as exemplified in the Flour City case
above mentioned. It is not improbable that further amplification
of the law, as recommended by the National Waterways
Commission in 1912, may be necessary. Probably, in
the light of bitter Southern Pacific experience, it was wise to
restrict Panama Canal traffic to water lines not under railroad
control. But any attempt to go farther and absolutely to
divorce rail and water lines without provision, even, for the
approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission in exceptional
cases, might be productive of great harm both to the
railroads and the public.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What will be the probable effect of the opening of the
Panama Canal upon the railroads of the United States? One
must consider the nature and volume of transcontinental
traffic. The most important fact is that nearly nine-tenths
of all transcontinental business at the present time moves by
rail.<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> The tonnage by vessel west bound either around Cape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>Horn or by the Isthmian routes has, to be sure, doubled within
five years to 1911. But by far the larger proportion of the
business moves by railroad direct. Secondly, it is important
to note that a large part of transcontinental traffic consists of
an exchange of commodities between the Middle West and the
Pacific coast. Over one-half of the rail shipments west bound
to Pacific terminals comes from west of Chicago. Less than
one-quarter of the through traffic of one of the principal transcontinental
roads originated at Atlantic coast points. And,
inasmuch as water competition is still mainly confined to
eastern seaboard territory, the diversion of this middle western
business from the rail routes will not be disastrous in amount.
In the opposite direction probably an even higher proportion
of business is carried by rail, the principal reason being that
much of the bulky freight of the Pacific slope,&mdash;lumber for
example,&mdash;is consumed throughout the treeless Mississippi
valley. None of this traffic naturally ever moves by water. It
is apparent, therefore, that the effect of opening the Panama
Canal, although great, will be for the most part localized as to
results.</p>

<p>Specifically stated, four distinct changes seem likely to be
brought about in the transcontinental situation. The first
will probably be a considerable stimulation to the merchants
and cities along the Atlantic seaboard throughout a zone extending
inland, perhaps, as far as Cleveland and Pittsburg.
A substantial drop in steamship rates will be followed, of course,
by a corresponding reduction in through rates to the Pacific
coast. But, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that
at best this tonnage is even today relatively unimportant to
the transcontinental railroads. More than two-thirds of their
through traffic, as we have just seen, now comes from the
Middle West. These railways will probably prefer to lose a
portion of this Atlantic seaboard business rather than to reduce
their rates upon perhaps four-fifths of the other traffic, as they
would otherwise have to do under the present system of postage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
stamp rates, from the Atlantic seaboard to the west of the
Missouri river.<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The eastern trunk lines, moreover, may
probably be relied upon to extend the low seaboard rates somewhat
farther inland than at present, rather than to divide low
or even lower through all-rail rates from the Atlantic to the
Pacific.</p>

<p>Next to the Atlantic seaboard territory, the so-called Intermountain
or Rocky mountain region, may be expected to
benefit substantially from the opening of the canal. It will
surely get lower direct rates than at present on all its supplies
from the East. Atlantic seaboard cities will doubtless also
seek to regain some of the business throughout this region,
which has been lost to them because of the growth of manufactures
in the Middle West. The transcontinental railroads
will seek to protect their clients in St. Louis and Chicago as
against the merchants in New York and Boston, who gain an
entrance to Denver and Spokane through the backdoor, so to
say. Not only will lower rates prevail, therefore, but there
will also probably be a larger proportion of supplies for these
mountain states drawn directly from the eastern seaboard.</p>

<p>The foregoing prognostication, at first glance, seems to
indicate that the Middle West is likely to profit less by the
opening of this great waterway than other parts of the country.
But it should be borne in mind that their hold upon west coast
trade is now most firmly established. A part, but certainly
only a part, of Pacific terminal business may be lost, but this
will be more than offset by the growth of intercourse with the
intermountain states. Surely the transcontinental railroads
west from St. Paul, Chicago, and St. Louis may be relied upon
to protect the direct exchange of goods of their constituents with
the intermountain communities. Transcontinental railway
rates will, of course, be lowered somewhat. The railways will,
however, probably prefer to surrender the lesser portion of
their present traffic in order to maintain profitable charges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
upon the major share of their tonnage. The profit of these
railways will doubtless for the moment be lessened; but there
can be little question that an enhancement of their prosperity
will follow in the long run. The opening of this great new
avenue of commerce by sea is bound to stimulate immensely
the growth and prosperity of the entire country. And it is
beyond question that in any such large development in future,
they will all share to a large degree.</p>
